<p class="pub2">Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1869, by<br />

<br />

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the summer of 1866, the author of this little
book, moved by the repeated and earnest solicitation
of his Medical Classes, prepared and printed a small
pamphlet entitled <i>Practical Principles of Medical
Electricity</i>, designed more particularly, as the present
work also is, as a <i>Hand-Book</i> to assist the memory
of those who have taken a regular course of <span class="smcap">Lectures</span>
from himself, or from some other competent
instructor in the same general system of Practice.
The edition of that work was exhausted somewhat
more than a year ago. Still, the book has continued
to be frequently called for. The author has, therefore,
prepared, and now offers to the Profession, the
present volume, comprising the substance of the
previous work&mdash;corrected, improved in arrangement
and form, and about doubled in size by the introduction
of new matter. While he has reason for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>gratitude that the former manual, referred to above,
has met with so favorable a reception, he can not
but hope that the present work will be found even
more acceptable and valuable to both practitioners
and their patients.</p>

<p>It is but justice to say that the most essential
principles of <i>practice</i> here presented did not originate
with the present author, but with <span class="smcap">Prof. C. H.
Bolles</span>, of Philadelphia, their discoverer, from
whom the writer received his first introduction to
them. Yet, the <i>explanations</i> here given of the Law
of Polarization, as respects the electric current in
the circuit of the artificial machine, as well as
respecting the natural magnets and magnetic currents
of the human organism; the introduction of
the <i>long cord</i>, with the explanation of its advantages;
and also nearly everything of the <i>philosophic
theories</i> here brought to view, the author alone is
responsible for.</p>

<p>This work, like its little predecessor from the
same pen, has been adapted exclusively to the use of
<span class="smcap">Dr. Jerome Kidder's</span> Electro-Magnetic Machine,
manufactured and sold, at present, at No. 544 Broadway,
New York; because the author, having used in
his own practice a considerable variety of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>popular machines intended for therapeutic purposes,
and having examined several others, believes this to
be incomparably <i>the best in use</i>. Dr. Kidder has,
with most laudable zeal, pressed on his researches
and improvements in the manufacture of these instruments,
until there seems to be scarcely anything
more in them to be desired. They are certainly not
equalled by any others in America, and probably not
surpassed, if equalled, by any in the world.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Considerable</span> parts of this book have been written
for the unlearned. For the scholarly reader such
parts, of course, would be wholly superfluous; yet it
is hoped that they to whom these are familiar will be
patient in passing through them for the sake of
others to whom they may be instructive. Other parts,
again, it is believed, will be found new to the most of
even educated minds. But men of the largest intellectual
attainments are commonly the most docile.
Such men, meeting this little work, will not shrink
from a candid examination of its contents merely on
account of their comparative novelty, nor because the
views expressed differ essentially from those usually
held by the medical faculty. The candid, yet critical,
attention of such gentlemen, the author especially
solicits. He assures them that he does not write at
random, but from careful research and practical experience.
His <i>philosophic theories</i> he offers only for
what they are worth. His <i>principles of practice</i> he
believes to be scientifically correct and of great value.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that the author, in this
work, assumes a belligerent attitude towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
members of the medical profession. Although anxious
to modify and elevate their estimate of electricity
as a remedial agent, and to improve their methods of
using it, he has no sympathy with those who profess
to believe, and who assert, that medicines of the
apothecary never effect the cure of disease; that where
they are thought to cure, they simply do not kill;
and who contend that the patient would have recovered
quicker and better to have taken no medicine at
all. He knows that such allegations are false, as
they are extravagant; and so does every candid and
unprejudiced observer whose experience has given
him ordinary opportunities to judge. The writer believes
it can be perfectly demonstrated that the advancement
of medical science in modern times&mdash;say
within the last two or three hundred years&mdash;has
served to essentially prolong the average term of
human life. The world owes to medical instructors
and practitioners a debt of gratitude which can never
be paid. Their laborious and often perilous research
in the fields of their profession, and their untiring
assiduity in the application of their science and skill
to the relief of human suffering, entitle them to a degree
of confidence and affectionate esteem which few
other classes of public servants can rightly claim.
For one, the author of this little book most sincerely
concedes to them, as a body, his confidence, his sympathy,
and his grateful respect. And the most that
he is willing to say to their discredit, (if it be so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
construed), is that he regards them as having not yet
attained <i>perfection</i> in their high profession, and as
not being generally as willing as they should be to
examine fairly into the alleged merits of remedial
agents and improved principles of practice, (claimed
to be such), when brought forward by intelligent,
cultivated and respectable men, outside of "the regular
profession." This is said at the same time that
the author gives much weight to their commonly
offered defense, viz: that, in the midst of professional
engagements, they have not always the time to spare
for such examination; and that, since the most of alleged
improvements in the healing art, particularly
of those introduced by persons who have not received
a regular medical education, sooner or later prove
themselves to be worthless, the <i>presumption</i>&mdash;though
not the <i>certainty</i>&mdash;is, whenever a new agent, or a new
method or principle is proposed by an "outsider,"
that this, too, if not willful charlatanism, is a mistake;
and therefore, the sooner it comes to an end
the better it will be for the public health, and that
neglect is the surest way to kill it.</p>

<p>But the medical faculty have too widely employed
electricity in the treatment of disease, and that with
too frequent success, to admit of its being denied a
place among important therapeutic agents by any respectable
practitioner. The only questions concerning
it now are those which relate to the <i>versatility</i> of
its power, the <i>scope</i> of its useful applicability, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
the <i>principles</i> which should guide in the administration
of it. The general subject embraced in these
questions is one in which suffering humanity has a
right to claim that physicians shall be at home.</p>

<p>And yet it will scarcely be denied that, in the exhibition
of electricity, more than of almost any other
therapeutic agent, medical practitioners feel incertitude
as to what shall be its effect. Now and then it
acts as they expected it to do; sometimes it pleasantly
surprises them; oftener it offensively disappoints
them. They find it <i>unreliable</i>. Of other remedial
agents, they commonly know, before administering
them, what <i>sort</i> of effect will be produced; but in employing
this, while they have hope, they are generally
more or less in doubt. They regard it as <i>a
stimulant</i>; although its action on the living organism
appears to them to be largely veiled in mystery. In
many cases of disease, particularly those of acutely
inflammatory or febrile character, they judge it to be
not at all indicated. To administer it in a case of
bilious or typhoid fever, or in a case of pneumonia,
pleuritis, gastritis, inflammatory rheumatism, or
acute, and especially <i>epidemic</i> or malignant dysentery,
or in a case of pulmonary phthisis, would probably
be viewed by the most of physicians as the
rashest empiricism, if not the next thing to madness.
<i>The idea of producing antagonistic effects with it at
will</i>, they would, for the most part, esteem preposterous.
Rather, perhaps, it may be said of the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of medical practitioners that such an idea has
never entered their minds; so foreign is it to their
conceptions of truth and propriety. But, at whatever
risk of discredit or censure, the writer of the
present volume avers that this idea is both scientifically
sound and of every day's practical verification.
The various and opposite forms of disease&mdash;acute
and chronic, hypersthenic and asthenic&mdash;are habitually
treated and <i>cured</i>, in his own practice and that
of his students, by electricity alone.</p>

<p>But "<i>cui bono?</i>" may be asked. "What if it be
true that these things can be done with electricity?
They are also done with medicines, which are more
quickly and conveniently administered, and usually
less annoying to the patient. What, therefore, is
the <i>practical utility</i> of your electric system above
the ordinary practice, especially if we include, in the
latter, electrical treatment as occasionally employed
by the most of respectable physicians?"</p>

<p>This is the important question&mdash;that to which
the author desires to call particular attention. He,
therefore, answers:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;It is manifestly true that the most of diseases,
(the exceptions are comparatively few), can be
cured by the use of medicines. It is also true that
these can generally be administered with more convenience
and less expenditure of time to the practitioner
than electricity; and this is a great advantage.
The author is often asked if he thinks his electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
system will ever supersede the use of medicines.
His answer is uniformly, "No." It takes too much
time for that. Where the population is crowded, as
in cities and large towns, it is often the case, especially
in times of prevailing epidemic, that a physician
can prescribe medicine for half a dozen or more
patients in the time required to treat one electrically.
To reject medicines and rely alone on electricity would,
in periods and places of prevailing sickness, leave
many sufferers without professional service, or would
require that the proportion of doctors to the whole
population should be largely increased&mdash;a thing certainly
not often to be desired. So much, candor
must concede.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;It is not quite true that medicines are
usually less annoying to the patient than electricity
as <i>we</i> use it. As administered by others, it is often
nearly intolerable. In our hands, on the contrary, it
seldom inflicts any pain or distress, and almost invariably
becomes agreeable to the patient after a very
few applications. We have no occasion to torture
our patients in order to cure them. But the cases
are comparatively rare where medicines are not
offensive; commonly they are excessively so.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;In not a few diseases, and these among
the most dangerous or distressful, the electric current,
employed according to the system here taught,
is able to reach, control and cure, with facility, where
medicines are but slowly, and in most instances imperfectly
successful, or fail altogether. This is said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
or meant to be said, not invidiously nor boastingly,
but in the candid utterance of a great and practically
demonstrated truth. It is, perhaps, most <i>often</i> exemplified
in neuralgic, rheumatic and paralytic affections.
The author is happy to acknowledge that
these diseases are frequently mitigated, and occasionally
cured, by means of electrical treatment administered
by those who know nothing of the system
here taught. But the important fact is, in <i>their</i>
hands there is <i>no certainty</i> as to the effect before
trial. Under <i>this</i> system, the kind of effect is as
certainly known before as after the trial, since it can
be made one thing or another <i>at will</i>.</p>

<p>Cases are not unfrequently presented of <i>inflammatory
action</i>, more especially where it is internal&mdash;traumatic
cases and others&mdash;which the practitioner
finds it impossible to subdue with medicine. But,
with a proper knowledge of the system herein taught,
he has at his command a power with which he can
control such cases with almost infallible certainty,
provided he can get access to them within reasonable
time. The same may be said of fevers, particularly
those occasioned by miasmatic or infectious virus.
These are often difficult to manage by the use of
medicine, and not seldom prove fatal, in spite of the
best talent and skill which the profession can afford.
But the electric current, rightly selected and scientifically
applied, destroys or neutralizes the virus
and restores the normal polarization, and so effects
a cure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neuralgic affections</i> are frequently found difficult,
or even impossible, to be cured by means of medicines,
and yet, in the very same cases, these affections
yield and disappear with comparative facility when
brought under the electric current, judiciously applied,
according to the principles of this new system.</p>

<p><i>Chronic cases, and others of an asthenic character</i>,
are often very stubborn under the medicines of pharmacy,
and are commonly the dread of physicians;
yet, under scientific treatment by electricity, they
rarely fail to lose their formidable character and to
become obedient to the remedial agent.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;In enumerating a few of the peculiar
advantages of this system, I should add that it corrects
the usual <i>electric</i> practice of the profession, so
far as they become acquainted with it. As before
intimated, the mass of physicians at present, who
treat more or less electrically, do so with no knowledge,
or next to none, of the great <i>versatility</i> of
action of which the electric current is capable. They
know nothing of the electrical polarization of the
living organism in health, nor how it is variously
affected in disease. The particular <i>electrical</i> state
of the diseased organs is a matter foreign to their
minds. They appear to suppose the point to be
immediately aimed at as a means of cure is to get
the electricity from the machine into the affected
part or parts; whereas it should be to change, by
correction, the <i>polarization</i> of the part or parts; and,
if there be virus present, to neutralize that. Equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
unacquainted are they generally with the diverse
physiological action of the several modifications of
the electric force&mdash;galvanism, magnetism, faradism,
and frictional electricity. This, in their candor, they
commonly acknowledge. And, for the most part,
they are little or nothing better acquainted with the
<i>distinctive</i> effects on the system of the positive and
negative poles of the instrument. There is, therefore,
plainly no <i>science</i> in their electrical practice.
Every thing is done at random&mdash;all is empirical.</p>

<p>But the system here taught opens the light upon
all of these points. For practical purposes, at least,
it is, in its essential features, the only system of
electrical therapeutics which has in it any real
merit&mdash;the only system which <i>can be true</i>. By this,
the writer does not mean to assert, or to imply, that
the little book now before the reader contains no
error, either in respect to theory or practice. In this
early stage of our system's history, it would be
remarkable if it did not contain errors in both these
respects. But what it is intended to affirm is, that
the book presents the <i>cardinal features</i> of a true,
and the only possibly true, system of electrical practice.
All possibly true systems of geometry must
necessarily be essentially the same; and so, too, all
possibly true systems of electrical medication must
be essentially one. That one system, it is candidly
and confidently believed, is briefly contained in the
present little volume.</p>

<h1>ELECTRICAL MEDICATION.</h1>

<h2>FIRST PRINCIPLES.</h2>

<h3>DR. JEROME KIDDER'S ELECTRO-MAGNETIC
MACHINE.</h3>

<p>On opening the machine-box, as it comes
from the manufacturer, there will be found a
glass bottle, intended to hold the battery fluid
when not in use; a glass cup or jar, to serve
as the battery cell; a pair of insulated metallic
conducting cords; two tin electrodes; a brass
clamp; and, under the helix-box, (which raise),
the battery metals and two connecting wires to
unite the battery with the helix.</p>

<p>To put the machine in working condition&mdash;ready
for use&mdash;proceed, step by step, as follows,
viz: Prepare the <i>Battery Fluid</i> by mixing
twelve parts, by measure, of water with one
part of sulphuric acid, (good commercial acid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is pure enough), sufficient to fill the cell two-thirds
or three-fourths full, and place in it
about one-third of an ounce of quicksilver.</p>

<p>Next, place the platina plate between the
two zinc plates, standing on their legs upon a
table before you; and bring the top of the
wooden bar (in a groove of which the platina
is set) up flush with the top of the zinc plates.
Let the brass post, standing on the top of this
bar and soldered to the platina plate below, be
toward the left-hand side. Then take the brass
clamp and place it across the top of these metallic
plates, a little to the right of the brass
post, or about midway between the right and
left sides, having its thumb-screw towards you,
and with it screw the three plates firmly
together. The platina is shorter than the zincs,
to prevent its reaching the quicksilver in the
bottom of the cell; and the wax balls on its
sides are to insulate it from the zinc plates.
This platina should never be allowed to touch
the mercury or the zinc.</p>

<p>Let the plates, properly screwed together, be
now placed in the cell with the Battery Fluid.
Then, with the two copper connecting-wires,
connect the post which stands on the wooden
bar above the platina with the post stamped P<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on the helix-box, and the brass clamp N with
the post N on the helix-box.</p>

<p>If, now, the screws regulating the vibrating
armature be in perfect adjustment, the current
will commence to run, with a buzzing sound;
or it may be made to start by touching the
hammer-like head of the flat steel spring. If
not, the screws may be rightly adjusted in the
following way: The top screw, which at its
lower point is tipped with a small coil of platina
wire, should be made to press delicately upon
the center of the little iron plate on the upper
side of the spring, so as to bear the latter
down very slightly. Then raise or depress the
screw-magnet, which turns up or down under
the hammer, like the seat of a piano-stool,
until the vibration of the spring commences.
The <i>rapidity of the vibrations</i>, by which is secured
the alternate closing and breaking of the
electric circuit (or rather what, in practical effect,
is equivalent to this&mdash;the <i>direct</i> and <i>reverse</i>
action of the current in alternation) is increased
by raising the screw-magnet and diminished by
lowering it. When it is raised above what is
required for ordinary use, the noise becomes
too loud and harsh for many nervous patients
to bear. It should then be depressed a little.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to curative power, I have discovered
but little perceptible difference, produced
by the various degrees of rapidity in the vibrations,
effected within the range of this magnet.</p>

<p><i>The force</i> of the current is regulated by
means of a tubular magnet, which slides over
the helix, and is called <i>the plunger</i>. It is approached
under a brass cap at the right-hand
end of the machine. The plunger is withdrawn,
more or less, to increase the force; pushed in
to diminish it. If in any case the current can
not be softened sufficiently with the plunger,
the quantity of battery fluid in use must be
made less.</p>

<p>After a time the current will become weak,
and fail to run well. Then renew the battery
fluid. When the quicksilver is all taken up
by the zinc plates, the machine may be run
for a while without adding more. But after it
has considerably disappeared from the inside
surface of the zinc plates, the latter will begin
to show more rapid corrosion, while the current
will be less. Then let a small quantity
of quicksilver&mdash;one-fourth to one-third of an
ounce&mdash;again be placed in the fluid.</p>

<p>When the machine is not in use, let the
metals be removed from the fluid; and, if not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to be soon again used, let them be rinsed with
water, carefully avoiding to wet the wooden
bar in which the platina is set.</p>

<p><i>The posts</i>, with which the conducting-cords
are to be connected, are arranged in a row
near the front of the helix-box, and are marked
A, B, C, D. Either two of these posts may be
used to obtain a current; and since they admit
of six varying combinations, six different currents
are afforded by the machine, viz: the
A B current, the A C current, the A D current,
the B C current, the B D current, and
the C D current. Whichever current is used,
it may always be known which of the two posts
employed is the positive and which the negative,
by observing the letters stamped upon
their tops. The one whose letter comes first
in the order of the alphabet is positive; the
other is negative. Also, the one standing
towards the left hand is positive, and that at
the right hand is negative. <i>The qualities</i> of
the several currents are stated in a descriptive
paper on the inside of the lid of the machine,
which see. It will there be found that three
of the currents&mdash;viz, the A B, the A C and the
A D currents&mdash;are <i>electrolytic</i>: that is, dissolving
by electric action. These electrolytic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
currents require to be used&mdash;one or another
of them&mdash;whenever any chemical action is
needed; as, in decomposing or neutralizing
<i>virus</i> in the system, destroying cancers, reducing
glands when chronically enlarged, removing
tumors or other abnormal growths, and in
treating old ulcers and chronic irritation of
mucous membranes. The other three, being
Faradaic or induction currents, and having no
perceptibly chemical action, are used where
only change of electro-vital polarization is required.
These Faradaic currents differ from
each other in respect to being <i>concentrative</i> or
<i>diffusive</i> in their effects, and in their <i>sensational</i>
force. B C is concentrative and delicately sensational.
C D is also concentrative, though
less so than B C, and is more strongly sensational.
B D is diffusive, and the most energetically
sensational of the three.</p>

<h3>POLARIZATION.</h3>

<p>It may be proper, in this place, to spend a few
words upon electrical polarization in general.</p>

<p><i>Electrical polarity</i> may be defined as a characteristic
of the electric or magnetic fluid, by
virtue of which its opposite qualities, as those
of <i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i> towards the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
object, are manifested in opposite parts of the
electric or magnetic body. These opposite
parts are called the <i>poles</i> of the body, as the
<i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i> poles. The difference
between the positive and negative poles is
believed to be that of <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i>&mdash;plus
being positive and minus negative. This is
the Franklinian view, and, if I mistake not,
is the one most in favor with men of science
at the present day. This view supposes that
the electricity or magnetism arranges itself in
<i>maximum</i> quantity and intensity at the one
extremity or pole of the magnetized body, and
in <i>minimum</i> quantity and intensity at the opposite
extremity or pole; and that, between
these points&mdash;the maximum and the minimum&mdash;the
fluid is distributed, in respect to
quantity and intensity, upon a scale of regular
graduation from the one to the other. The
idea may be represented by a <i>line</i>, commencing
in a <i>point</i> at the one end, and extending,
with regularly increasing breadth, to the other
end. The larger end would represent the positive
pole, and the smaller, the negative pole.
Or perhaps a better representation of the magnet
would be a line of equal breadth from end
to end, but having the one end <i>white</i>, or slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
tinted, say, with <i>red</i>, and the color gradually
and regularly increasing in strength to the
other end, where it becomes a <i>deep scarlet</i>.
Let the coloring-matter represent the magnetism
in the body charged, and we have the
magnet illustrated in its polarization: the deep-red
end is the positive pole, and the white or
faintly-colored end is the negative pole.</p>

<p>It is a law of polarization that the positive
poles of different magnets repel each other, and
the negative poles repel each other; while positive
and negative poles attract each other.
The same law of polarization rules in electric
or magnetic <i>currents</i> as in magnets at rest.</p>

<h3>THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT.</h3>

<p><i>The Electric Circuit</i> is made up of any thing
and every thing which serves to conduct the
electric current in its passage&mdash;outward and
returning&mdash;from where it leaves the inner surfaces
of the zinc plates in the battery cell to
where it comes back again to the outer surfaces
of the same plates. When the conducting-cords
are not attached to the machine, or
when the communication between the cords is
not complete, if the machine be running, the
circuit is then composed of the battery fluid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the platina plate, the posts, the connecting-wires,
which unite the battery with the helix,
the helical wires, and their appendages for the
vibrating action. But when a patient is under
treatment, the conducting-cords, the electrodes,
and so much of the patient's person as is traversed
by the current while passing from the
positive electrode through to the negative electrode,
are also included in the whole circuit.
And whatever elements may serve to conduct
the current in any part of its circuit&mdash;be they
metal, fluid, nerve, muscle, or bone&mdash;the same
are all, for the time, component parts of <i>one
complete magnet</i>, which, in all its parts, is subject
to the law of polarization, precisely as if
it were one magnetized bar of steel. Usually,
however, it is sufficient for <i>practical</i> purposes
to contemplate the circuit as consisting only of
that which the current passes through in going
from the point where it leaves the positive
post and enters into the negative cord, around
to the point where it leaves the positive cord
and enters into the negative post.</p>

<h3>POLARIZATION OF THE CIRCUIT.</h3>

<p>I have said, in effect, a little above, that,
while the current is running, <i>the entire circuit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is one complete magnet</i>, which extends from
the inner or positive sides of the zinc plates,
where the current commences, all the way
around to the outer or negative aides of the
zinc plates, to which it returns. Viewed in
this light its negative pole or end is the
battery fluid, next to the positive surfaces of
the zinc plates, and its positive pole or end is
the brass clamp which, holding the metals
together, is in contact with the outer and negative
surfaces of the zincs.</p>

<p>But, for practical purposes, it is sufficiently
exact to consider the <i>magnetic circuit</i> as extending
only from the positive <i>post</i> around
through the conducting cords, the electrodes
and the person of the patient to the <i>negative</i>
post. The negative end or pole of this magnet
is the wire end of the cord placed in the
positive post, and the positive end or pole is the
wire end of the cord placed in the negative post.</p>

<p>But any magnet may be viewed either as
one whole, or be conceived as composed of a
succession of shorter magnets placed end to
end. If we view it as one entire magnet, we
call the end in which the magnetic essence is in
greatest quantity the <i>positive</i> end, and the end
where it is in least quantity the <i>negative</i> end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
But if we imagine the one whole magnet as
being divided up into several sections, then we
conceive of each section as a distinct magnet,
having its own positive and negative poles.
And, all the way through, these sectional magnets
will be arranged with the positive pole of
the one joined to the negative pole of the next
in advance of it.</p>

<p>It is just so in respect to the magnetic circuit
of a moving current. The whole circuit,
as before remarked, is in reality one long magnet.
But in applying the terms <i>positive</i> and
<i>negative</i> in our practice we often view the
whole circuit&mdash;the one long magnet&mdash;as composed
of a series of shorter ones, arranged
with positive and negative ends in contact;
and all the way the current in each section is
supposed to be running from the positive pole
of the magnet behind to the negative pole of
the magnet before.</p>

<p>We consider the circuit, from the positive
post around to the negative post, as composed
of three magnets, as follows: Magnet No. 1,
which extends from the positive post, along
the cord and electrode, to the body of the patient,
where the positive electrode is placed.
The <i>negative pole</i> of this magnet is the <i>wire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
end of the cord</i> placed in the positive post, and
its <i>positive</i> pole in the <i>positive electrode</i> placed
upon the person of the patient. No. 2, which
is composed of the parts of the patient traversed
by the current between the two electrodes.
Its negative end or pole is the part in
contact with the positive pole of magnet No. 1,
and its positive pole is the part in contact with
the negative pole of magnet No. 3. No. 3 extends
from the positive pole of No. 2, through
the electrode and along the cord, to the negative
post. Its negative pole is the <i>negative
electrode</i> in contact with the positive end or
pole of magnet No. 2, and its positive pole is
the <i>wire end of the cord</i> in the negative post.</p>

<p>Since in every magnet the magnetic fluid is
supposed to be regularly graduated from minimum
quantity in the negative end to maximum
quantity in the positive end, this is true
in respect to the one magnet, consisting of the
whole magnetic circuit, as well as in respect
to each one of the sectional series. Consequently
there must be the same quantity of
magnetism in each negative pole of the sections
as there is in the positive pole of the
section immediately behind it. And the magnetism
of the whole circuit between the positive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and the negative posts is in its <i>least</i>
volume next to the <i>positive post</i>, and in <i>fullest</i>
volume next to the <i>negative post</i>. If we consider
the circuit as divided into two equal
halves, the <i>negative half</i> is plainly that which
joins the <i>positive post</i>, and the <i>positive half</i>
that which joins the <i>negative post</i>.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that what in practice
are designated as the positive and negative
<i>posts</i>, and also positive and negative <i>poles</i> or
<i>electrodes</i> are <i>not</i> such <i>in relation to each other</i>,
but the <i>reverse</i> of it; that is to say, the positive
<i>post</i> is not <i>positive</i> in relation to the <i>negative
post</i>, but is <i>negative</i> to it; and the positive
<i>electrode or pole</i> is not positive in relation to
the <i>negative</i> electrode, but <i>negative</i> to it. The
positive <i>post</i>, like the positive <i>electrode</i>, is
called <i>positive</i>, because it is the positive end
of the sectional magnet next <i>behind</i> it. And
the <i>negative</i> post, as also the negative electrode,
is <i>called negative</i> because it is the negative
end of the sectional magnet next <i>in
advance</i> of it.</p>

<h3>THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE CIRCUIT.</h3>

<p><i>The central point</i> of the circuit&mdash;that point
which divides between its positive and negative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
halves&mdash;is reckoned, in practice, to be the
midway point in the line over which the current
passes, in its whole course from the positive
post around to the negative post. When
the cords are of equal length, this point will
always be in the person of the patient, about
midway between the parts where the two electrodes
are applied. This central point, or
"point of centrality," is practically neuter&mdash;neither
positive nor negative; and upon the
two opposite halves of the circuit, the positive
and negative <i>qualities</i> of the current are in
greatest force nearest to the posts, and in least
force nearest to the central point. At this
point they cease altogether, and the central
point is <i>neuter</i>.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be observed that, in <i>apparent</i>
contradiction of this statement, the <i>sensational</i>
effect of the current on the negative
half of the circuit is <i>least</i> nearest to the positive
post, and becomes regularly <i>greater</i> as the
current advances towards the central point;
and that <i>at</i> this point it is greater than at any
other point between this and the positive post.
To relieve this seeming contradiction, it is
only necessary to consider that, in fact, the
<i>positive</i> state on the negative half of the current<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<i>does</i> increase regularly from the positive post
to the central point. But that which is the
<i>increase</i> of the positive state is the <i>decrease</i> of
the negative state. So it is still true that on
the negative half of the circuit, the <i>negative</i>
qualities <i>diminish</i> as we advance towards the
central point just as on the positive half, the
<i>positive</i> qualities diminish regularly towards
the central point, as stated above.</p>

<h3>THE CURRENT.</h3>

<p><i>The current</i> is that moving electric essence
which traverses the circuit. The <i>course</i> of the
current is always from the positive to the negative.
It leaves the machine at the positive
post, where it enters the cord which holds the
positive electrode or pole. Thence it advances
around the circuit, going out from the opposite
cord where that connects with the negative
post. The forward end of the current is its
positive end; the rear, of course, is its negative
end. At its forward end it is in its greatest
volume. At its rear end the volume is least.
At the <i>central point</i> of its circuit there is the
<i>mean</i> quantity&mdash;the <i>average</i> volume. And
because the positive and negative forces on
either side exactly balance each other upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the central point, therefore this point is practically
neuter&mdash;neither positive nor negative.</p>

<h3>MODIFICATIONS OF ELECTRICITY.</h3>

<p>In the present stage of electric science, the
conviction has become very general among experimenters
that galvanism, magnetism, faradism,
frictional electricity and the electricity
of the storm-cloud are, in their essential nature,
one and the same; being diversified in appearance
and effects by the different modes and
circumstances of their development. This conviction
has been reached in various ways; but
chiefly, perhaps, by observing the many analogies
between the phenomena of these several
forces, and also by the fact that each of them
can be made to produce or be produced by one
or more of the others. But I must forego any
detailed discussion of this matter, since my
limits will not admit of it, and shall assume that
these apparently several agents are but modifications
of the same generic force.</p>

<p>There are two other phases or modifications
of the electric principle, as I judge them to be,
which are not so generally classed here. I
refer to the forces of animal and vegetable
vitality, as viewed in the next section.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h3>VITAL FORCES&mdash;ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE.</h3>

<p>Upon these points I must be permitted to
offer a few words.</p>

<p>Of the <i>animal kingdom</i>, I regard the "nervous
fluid" or "nervous influence," popularly so
called, as being the very principle of <i>animal
vitalization</i>&mdash;the life force; and that, a modification
of the <i>electric</i> force. It is, I think,
pretty generally conceded at this day that
the "nervous influence" is probably electric.
There are some alleged facts, and other certain
facts, which go far to sustain this view. It is
said that if we transfix, with a steel needle, a
large nerve of a living animal, as the great
ischiatic, and let it remain in that condition a
suitable time, the needle becomes permanently
magnetized. So, too, if the point of a lancet
be held for some length of time between the
severed ends of a newly-divided large nerve,
that point, as I have heard it affirmed, on what
appeared to be good authority, becomes magnetized;
although I have not attempted to
verify either of these cases by experiment.
However, admitting them to be true, the metal
is charged with simply the "nervous fluid."
But the fact on which I myself chiefly rely for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
evidence of this identification, being almost
daily conversant with it in my practice, is this:
<i>The "nervous influence" obeys the laws of electrical
polarization, attraction and repulsion.</i>
When I treat a paralyzed part, in which, to
all appearance, the action of the nerve force
is suspended, I have but to assume that this
force is electric, and apply the poles of my
instrument accordingly, and I <i>bring it in</i> from
the more healthy parts, along with the inorganic
current from my machine. Forcing conduction
through the nerves, by means of my
artificial apparatus, I rouse the susceptibility
of the nerves until they will normally conduct
the "nervous influence" or electro-vital fluid,
as I term it, and the paralysis is removed.
Again, if I treat an inflamed part, in which the
capillaries are engorged with arterial blood,
I have but to assume that the affected part
is overcharged with the electro-vital fluid,
through the nerves and the arterial blood, and
so to apply my electrodes, according to well
known electrical law, as to produce mutual
repulsion, and the inflammatory action is sure
to be repressed. I manifestly change the polarization
of the parts. This thing is so perfectly
regular and constant that I am entirely assured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
before touching the patient, what sort
of effect will be produced by this or that
arrangement in the application of the poles of
the instrument. If I desire to increase or depress
the nervous force in any given case, I
find myself able, on this principle, to produce
the one effect or the other, at will. Hence, I
say, the nervous influence obeys the electric
laws, just as does the inorganic electricity. I
find this subtle agent not in the nerves only,
but also in muscle and blood&mdash;more especially
in arterial blood. Indeed it seems to pervade,
more or less, the entire solids and fluids of the
animal system. And wherever it exists, its
action is just that of an <i>electro-vital</i> force.
Examples of this fact will appear further along
in the present work. While, therefore, I can
not <i>affirm</i> the identity of animal electricity and
animal vitality, the theory of their identification,
to my view, best accords with the manifestations
under correct therapeutic treatment,
and I am unaware of any established fact to
disprove it.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable vitality</i>, also, I regard as another
modification of the electric force. The fact
has been proved by repeated experiments, that
galvanic currents, passed among the roots of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
vegetables, causes a quickened development of
the plants to a degree that would be deemed
incredible by almost any one who had neither
seen it nor learned its <i>rationale</i>. I have seen
it stated, on authority which commanded my
credence, that by this process lettuce leaves
may be grown, within a few hours only, "from
the size of a mouse's ear to dimensions large
enough for convenient use on the dinner-table."</p>

<p>The following experiment has been related
to me by several different parties, as having
been made by <i>Judge Caton</i>, of Ottawa, Illinois;
and subsequently the same has been confirmed
to me by his brother, Deacon Wm. P. Caton,
of Plainfield, Illinois. It is said that the Judge
had some interesting <i>evergreens</i> which appeared
to be affected by an unhealthy influence, causing
a suspension of growth and withering of
branches here and there, until such branches
died. So the process went on, terminating
after a little time in the death of the trees.
In this way he had lost some valuable specimens.
At length a very fine and favorite
evergreen was similarly attacked. He felt, of
course, annoyed by the destructive process,
and especially reluctant to lose this particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
tree. Probably calling to his recollection something
analogous to what I have referred to
above, he resolved to try the efficacy of galvanism
to reinforce the vitality of the shrub.
Having a telegraphic wire extending from the
main line in Ottawa to his own residence, he
availed himself of this facility, and caused a
wire to be passed among the roots of this tree
in such a way as to bring the galvanic current
to act upon them. It was not long before he
saw, to his delight, a new set of foliage starting
from the twigs, and after a little time the
tree was again flourishing in all its beauty.
The electric current had evidently imparted to
it a fresh vitality.</p>

<p>To insure the success of such an experiment,
a proper regard to polarization must be had,
such as is taught in the system presented in
this book. There may not have been any attention
to this matter in the case just related;
but if not, the Judge must have <i>stumbled</i> upon
the correct application of poles. To have
brought the roots under the influence of the
wrong pole would have made sure the death of
his tree.</p>

<p>Now, although, if taken by themselves, such
experiments could not be regarded as <i>conclusive</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in favor of the electric nature of vegetable
vitality, notwithstanding that this theory best
explains the phenomena; yet, when considered
in connection with the fact that the nervous
fluid of the animal kingdom is evidently a modification
of electricity, and probably constitutes
the vital force of the animal, the theory of its
identification, under another modification, with
the vital principle in the vegetable kingdom
also, as deduced from experiments like those
just adverted to, receives strong confirmation,
and is now, I believe, being adopted by many
of the best philosophers of the age.</p>

<h3>EXTENT OF ELECTRIC AGENCY.</h3>

<p>When we have settled upon the position that
the electricity of the heavens and of the artificial
machine are identical, and that their
identity is essentially one with galvanism,
magnetism, the electro-vital fluid of animal and
the life-force of the vegetable kingdoms, it
requires no extravagant imagination, nor remarkable
degree of enthusiastic credulity, to
suppose that all the forms of physical attraction
and repulsion are due, under God, to the diversified
modifications of the same all-pervading
agent&mdash;<span class="smcap">Electricity</span>. Indeed, for myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I feel no hesitation in expressing it as my
belief that electricity, in one phase or another,
and controlled only by <span class="smcapl">WILL</span>, is the grand
motive-power of the universe. I believe that,
in the form of electro-vital fluid, the great
Creator employs it as His immediate agent to
carry on all the functions of animal life; and
that, in respect to voluntary functions, He subordinates
it as a servant to the will of the creature,
to effect such cerebral action and such
muscular contractions as are demanded by the
creature's volitions. I am disposed to think
that, by the omnipotent power of His will, He
controls and uses electricity, in its various
modifications, as the immediate moving-force
by which He accomplishes all the changes in
the physical universe. It is fast becoming a
generally-received opinion among modern <i>savans</i>,
that every body in nature is really magnetic,
more or less; and that all visible or
sensible changes are but the result of changing
poles. Chemical affinities and revulsions are
believed to be only the more delicate forms of
electrical attraction and repulsion; the ultimate
particles of matter, no less than matter in
masses, being subject to the control of electrical
laws. The imponderable agents, light and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
caloric, under the ingenious tests of scientific
scrutiny, are beginning to give some very decided
indications of being simply electric phenomena.
Indeed, the doctrine or theory that
supposes caloric to be simply <i>atomic motion</i> is
even now being very generally accepted by the
scientific world. And that motion in the atoms
of a body which causes in us the sensation of
heat is probably electric motion. And permit
me to observe that, though the operations of
nature seem, at first thought, to be wonderfully
complex and mysterious, yet if the views here
presented be correct, the marvel is changed;
and we are brought to a profound admiration
of the <i>simplicity</i> of the means by which the
Almighty conducts His material operations. A
<i>single</i> agent made to perform processes so infinitely
numerous, diversified and apparently
complex! How amazing! Simplicity in complexity!&mdash;majestic,
like the mind of God.</p>

<h3>THEORY OF MAN.</h3>

<p>Let the question now be raised&mdash;<i>What is
man?</i> The answer will have much to do with
the remedial system which I aim to teach.
For this reason it is thus early introduced.</p>

<p>My answer to the above question is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<i>Man is a threefold being, composed of a
body material, a body electrical, and a spirit
rational and indestructible.</i></p>

<p>Let the elements of this definition be a little
amplified:</p>

<p>1. <i>The material body.</i> This is composed of
various metals, earths, carbon, phosphorus, and
gases. I need not go into a representation of
their multiplied and curious combinations to
form the many parts of the body complete.
But these are the ultimate elements; and a
most superb and wonderful structure they here
compose. Yet, notwithstanding all the manifest
skillfulness of its contrivance, and the
power of its accomplishment, and the niceness
and beauty of its execution, it were a useless
display if unaccompanied with the invisible
agents which compose the two other grand constituents
of man, to wit: the body electrical
and the spirit, or mind. Without these, it
would quickly fall into decay, as we see it
when deprived of them, and would be resolved
into its original elements again. But to our
gross material bodies the Creator has added,</p>

<p>2. <i>The body electrical.</i> By this, I mean that
which has commonly been termed "nervous
influence," "nervous fluid," "nervo-vital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fluid," and "nervo-electric fluid." I object,
however, to each and all of these designations.
They are too restricted and specific. They all
seem to imply that it is an agent or influence
which appertains especially to the <i>nervous</i> system;
whereas the entire organism is under its
pervading force. I do not doubt but its chief
action is in and through the nervous system;
but it also pervades and, as I think, vitalizes
the whole body. The nervous system seems
to be created as one principal means for its
replenishment,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and to serve as the medium of
its ministrations to the body at large. I choose
to term it <i>electro-vital fluid</i>, or <i>electro-vitality</i>.
My reasons for so designating it are the following:
(1) It is demonstrably electrical in its
nature. (2) It appears to be identified, or at
least connected immediately, with the vitalization
of the body. (3) I wish, by its name, to
distinguish it from <i>mental</i> vitality, or the vitality
of <i>spirit</i>. Whether, as a peculiar manifestation
of the electric principle, it vitalizes
by its own nature and action solely, or whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
it be <i>charged</i> with another mysterious element&mdash;a
<i>life-force</i>&mdash;and vitalizes by ministering
the latter to the material organism, I will
not positively affirm. Whichever it be, the
name I assign to it seems sufficiently appropriate.
But I strongly incline to the theory
that this electro-vital principle does itself, by
virtue of its own nature, vitalize the system.
In other words, I am disposed to think that
God makes it the <i>immediate</i> agent of vitalization;
having constituted it the <i>vis vit&aelig;</i> of both
the animal and the vegetable kingdoms. Nor
does this idea, as I conceive, necessarily conflict
at all with the doctrine of <i>cell-life</i>, as
maintained by the best physiologists of the
present day. I also sometimes style this electro-vital
element the <i>body electrical</i>, because it
is certainly an entity, co&euml;xtensive with and,
in greater or less force, wholly pervading the
visible, material body.</p>

<p>At this point I will take the liberty to introduce,
although somewhat digressively, a
few thoughts on the <span class="smcapl">DISTINCTIONS OF VITALITY
OR LIFE.</span></p>

<p>There are, as I suppose, the following several
kinds of life: (1) <i>Spirit life</i>; (2) <i>Moral life</i>;
(3) <i>Electric life</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>(1.) There is <i>spirit</i> life. And here are to
be made several subdivisions.</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Uncreated</i> spirit life. This is the life
of God. Of the nature of the Divine Essence
we know nothing; yet that God is a real, living
entity, we do know. My own conviction
is that the divine essence and the divine life
are identical; that God, a spirit, is necessary,
infinite, conscious <span class="smcap">Vitality</span>&mdash;the voluntary
Originator of all existencies besides himself.
But as to what is the essential nature of this
vitality&mdash;this eternal spirit-life&mdash;we can have
no conception, only that this life is God.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Created</i> spirit-life. And here we make
another subdivision.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The life of created <i>immortal</i> spirit. This
is a rational, intelligent entity, representing
the spirit of man and of unembodied, created
intelligences above him. This spirit God created
as it pleased him&mdash;"in his own likeness"&mdash;a
living, indestructible essence; and,
as I suppose, its essence and its life the same.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The life of created <i>mortal</i> spirit, as the
spirit of the beast. Of the intrinsic essence of
this spirit, we are also necessarily ignorant.
Yet, of its attributes we know that it has <i>consciousness</i>,
<i>sensibility</i>, and <i>will</i>. Of its life we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
know as little as of its essence; both of which,
however, as I conjecture, are also one and the
same&mdash;the spirit substance being itself essentially
vital.</p>

<p>(2.) We pass next to <i>moral</i> life. This life
is identical with <i>holiness</i>&mdash;the very opposite of
that defilement that characterizes moral <i>death</i>,
which is a state of <i>sin</i>. But let me again subdivide.</p>

<p>[1.] As to the moral life of <i>God</i>, it consists
in his infinite moral purity&mdash;his <i>veracity</i>, <i>justice</i>
and <i>benevolence</i> or <i>love</i>&mdash;qualities which,
in their combination make up his holiness.</p>

<p>[2.] The moral life of <i>man, as also of other
rational creatures</i>. This consists in his <i>sympathy
of spirit with God</i> in respect to those
pure qualities which constitute the Divine
holiness.</p>

<p>(3.) Finally, there is <i>electric</i> or <i>physical life</i>.
But here again there are varieties.</p>

<p>[1.] There is <i>animal</i> life, as of man and the
lower animals. This I have already represented
as consisting in the electro-vital force.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Vegetable</i> life. This is another modification
of the same essential principle&mdash;electro-vitality.</p>

<p>But now, to return to the <i>physical</i> or <i>animal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
life of man</i>&mdash;the electro-vital element. While
this is in such <i>immediate</i> relation to the visible
body on the one hand, it holds, also, on the
other hand, an <i>immediate</i> relation to the mental
part, both of man and of the other animated
beings of earth. It serves to transmit, through
the nervous system to the mind, all sensations
and impressions from the outer world. It,
moreover, receives from the mind the action of
its volitions and imaginary conceptions, and
conveys through the nerves the impressions or
impulsions thus obtained to the various parts of
the body, and there secures the fulfillment of
the mind's behests. It appears to be only in
this way that communication is had between
the mind and its outer body. The natures of
spirit and of gross matter are so totally unlike,
that it seems impracticable for the mind and
body to come into <i>immediate</i> mutual relation,
or to act reciprocally, without the aid of a
<i>medium</i>&mdash;ethereal, semi-material and semi-spiritual,
such as is the electro-vital fluid. And
the Creator has accordingly provided this mysterious,
invisible medium between the two, and
thus, in a degree, extended man's likeness to
himself by making him <i>a trinity in unity</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The mind or spirit.</i> This is immeasurably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the highest and most important constituent
of man. His body material may fall back
to dust. His body electrical may be reabsorbed
in the great ocean of natural electricity that
fills the earth and the heavens. But his mind
is immortal. His spirit, made in the divine
image, lives and acts, thinks and feels, independently
of every other existence save Him
from whom its being came. While in connection
with its visible body, its good or ill, its
bliss or woe, has, indeed, much to do with its
bodily state. But, when separated from this
body, its high and more independent existence
is at once asserted; and then its good or ill
are determined by its Author only in accordance
with the workings and affections within
itself. A spiritual and indestructible being
like its Creator, it can never cease to be while
he exists.</p>

<p>But our present concern is with the mind in
its relation to that electro-vital medium between
it and the body, and to the body itself. The
mind's influence upon both of these lower parts
of the entire man is truly wonderful, although
perceptible mostly on the material body. Few
persons are aware how much the state of the
mind affects the bodily health, although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
degree is often very great. Yet this is done
by the mind's action, first on the electro-vital
functions, and through these, by way of the
nerves, upon the bodily tissue. Changes in
the mental states will, in this way, frequently
produce changed polarization in the physical
organs, and thus determine infallibly the matter
of health or disease. So, too, the condition
of the bodily health will often determine irresistibly
the mental state. Whatever bodily
changes affect the polarization of the electro-vital
medium in any part of the organism, do
thereby produce corresponding changes in the
mind.</p>

<p>These views of the reciprocal action between
mind and body, through the medium of the
electro-vital element, may serve to explain
those psychological wonders exhibited in the
cure of diseases by the imagination, as well as
in diseases and even death induced by the imagination.
I would much like to unfold and
illustrate this bearing of the subject; and, also,
in the light of it, to show the <i>philosophy</i> of one
mind acting intelligibly on another mind, with,
and even <i>without</i>, the aid of the physical
organs, as is sometimes seen in the facts of
mesmerism. This I have done in my written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lectures, for the instruction of classes; but my
limits will not admit of it here.</p>

<p>There is another thought which I will offer
in this connection. I maintain that all <i>functional</i>
action of our bodily organism, <i>ab initio</i>,
is conducted by <i>thinking mind</i>, through the
medium of organic electricity or the electro-vital
fluid. Every organ as a whole, and every
life-cell in detail, is charged with this active
principle. I believe that every one of then is
controlled and guided incessantly in its propagating,
organizing and entire functional force
by <i>intelligent mind</i>, acting through this wonder-working
agent&mdash;the electro-vital fluid. In respect
to our <i>voluntary</i> exercises, this organic
electrical force is made subject to our own
mental activities, and executes its office upon
the bodily organism mainly through the medium
of the nerves. But, as regards all the
<i>involuntary</i> functions, I believe that control is
exercised <i>directly</i> by the omniscient and all-pervading
God, although in accordance with
his own established laws.</p>

<p>Once more of the <i>mind</i> let me remark, that
<i>consciousness, sensation, and will belong to it
alone</i>. The <i>body</i> never thinks nor feels; nor
does the organic electricity within it. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
popular idea, especially with the less educated
masses, is that, if a man burn his finger, it is
the finger that smarts. But this can not be
true. Pain can exist only where consciousness
is. And there is no consciousness in the
finger, nor in any material part. Only the
<i>mind</i> is conscious of <i>existence</i>, even; and hence
only the mind can be conscious of pleasure or
pain. If a limb be paralyzed, by interrupting
in any way the flow of the electro-vital fluid
through its nerves, and thus depriving the
<i>mind</i> of its medium of communication with it,
you may burn that limb to a crisp and the
subject will feel no pain. When you burn your
finger or break your arm, you disturb the
action of the electro-vitality in the injured
part, deranging its poles. This electric agent
instantly communicates its disturbance along
the nerves to the brain, where it reports to
the mind and tells where the disturbance is.
The conscious mind takes cognizance of the
fact and feels distress.</p>

<h3>THE LOWER ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>It may, by some, be objected that, if we
regard sensation as existing only in the <i>mind</i>,
as affirmed above, then we must concede mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to the lower animal tribes, since they are subjects
of consciousness, sensation and will, as
truly as ourselves. I admit this necessity, and
unhesitatingly take the position, as has been
already done in the classification of minds, that
the lower animals are in fact endowed with a
something higher and more spiritual than their
material bodies or their animal vitality&mdash;something
which bears distinguishing characteristics
of <i>mind</i>. I would not, however, be understood
to say, or to imply, that they possess <i>all</i>
the characteristics of our minds, even in a
rudimental degree. I do not believe they do.
My theory does not accord to them either
reason or immortality. Yet, in respect to the
latter, my views are less decisive, and my
utterances usually more reserved. But I think
their minds may, and probably do, perish with
their bodies. Nevertheless, the existence of
consciousness, sensation and will, in any orders,
does evidently presuppose some sort of mental
constitution. And such mental structure, in
them as well as in us, must be distinct from
and superior to the animal vitality&mdash;compelling
service from the latter, and using it as a
medium for communicating with the body, and
with the outer world in general.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</h3>

<p>As to the vegetable kingdom, there is here,
so far as we can discover, only a duality of
principle, viz: the material body and a modified
phase of electro-vitality. These component
parts appear to sustain to each other, in
the vegetable, relations quite analogous to those
of the corresponding parts in the animal. But
here the <i>mental</i> part is wanting; and consequently
there is no consciousness, sensation,
nor will; and the electro-vital action is guided
in its elaborate and beautiful operations for
the forming and developing of the plant, and
in all its vital functions, by the all-pervading
mind of God.</p>

<h3>NATURAL POLARIZATION OF MAN'S PHYSICAL
ORGANISM.</h3>

<p><i>The electro-vital fluid</i>, in the animal economy,
is subject to the same principles of polarization
as the magnetic current from the
artificial machine, or the magnetism of the
bar-magnet. In the material organism of man,
the great nerve-centers&mdash;the brain, the spinal
cord, and the ganglions&mdash;appear to act the
part of fixed magnets, charged with the electro-vital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fluid. Indeed, there is much reason
to believe that this fluid is elaborated within
these nerve-centers&mdash;more especially within
the brain&mdash;from the inorganic electricity of
the outer world, which is supplied through the
lungs in respiration, and conducted thence to
these laboratories by a remarkably interesting
process&mdash;a process which I have not room
here to describe, but which I have drawn out
in detail in a manuscript lecture on the circulation
of the blood, for my classes, and which
may some day see the light. These nerve-centers,
viewed as magnets of electro-vitality,
require to be regarded as having each a positive
nucleus in the interior, on which are
ranged the negative ends of the currents which
go out from this positive nucleus in every direction
to the surface of the medullary organ&mdash;so
radiating, as it were, from center to periphery.
And the nerve-lines and ramifications
which issue from these great nerve-centers are
polarized evidently in the same way&mdash;the
electro-vital fluid being disposed with its negative
ends to the positive surfaces of the
nerve-centers, and its positive or plus ends to
the "vital organs," and especially to the surfaces
of the organism as a whole. There are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
many other polarizations in the human system,
subordinate to those mentioned above; but I
have no room to speak of them in detail.</p>

<h3>ELECTRICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES.</h3>

<p>There are two, and only two, primary classes
of disease&mdash;those in which the electro-vital
force is abnormally <i>positive</i>, and those where
it is preternaturally <i>negative</i>. The former class
comprises every variety and phase of hypersthenia,
and the latter, every sort and degree of
an&aelig;sthesia, or rather, of azo&ouml;dynamia. <i>Inflammation</i>
may be taken as a general representative
of the positive or hypersthenic class&mdash;those
forms of disease in which there is too
much electro-vitality, or in which the vital
force may be said to be too active. <i>Paralysis</i>
may stand as a general representative of the
negative or azo&ouml;dynamic class&mdash;those in which
the vital action is too low or weak.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHY OF DISEASE AND CURE.</h3>

<p>In every part of the animal economy, polar
derangements in the electro-vital principle are
liable to occur. These derangements are always
the real foundation of disease. They may be
occasioned by a thousand agencies, which act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
as the <i>procuring</i> cause of disease; but the
<i>proximate</i> and <i>sustaining</i> cause is polar disturbance&mdash;derangement
of the electro-vital
poles. Parts which, in health, are relatively
positive, may become negative, and that which
should be negative may become positive. Or
again, a part, naturally positive to its counterpart,
may become <i>excessively</i> so, and that which
should be relatively negative may become negative
to a <i>morbid degree</i>.</p>

<p>To correct these polar disturbances and restore
the normal polarization, is to <i>cure the
complaint</i>. This is, under the treatment of
most physicians, often accomplished by the use
of medicines, and by mechanical or surgical
agency. We accomplish it by the proper application
of the <i>poles</i> of our electrical apparatus.
In cases where there is <i>virus</i> to be destroyed,
or <i>abnormal growths</i> to be removed, we also
secure the <i>chemical</i> action appropriate to these
ends by the proper <i>selection of our current</i>.
It often happens that <i>mechanical</i> or <i>surgical
action</i> is demanded. In many <i>such</i> cases, we
do not profess to secure normal polarization
and consequent cure by means of electricity
alone. Yet, in a large proportion of the cases
where mechanical or surgical agency is usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thought to be indispensable, we are able to
cure by electric action only, since by it we
can exert very considerable mechanical force
at will; and can also, in many instances, attain
much more happily, by means of electricity,
the very ends or the <i>best</i> ends which would be
aimed at by skillful surgical operations.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICE.</h2>

<h3>POLAR ANTAGONISM.</h3>

<p><i>When the conducting cords are of equal length</i>,
as commonly they should be, each of the two
poles or electrodes produces a polar effect in
the patient directly the opposite of that produced
by the other. Also, <i>at any point</i> in
either half of the circuit, if it be within the
person of the patient, the polar effect produced
is the very reverse of what is experienced at
the corresponding point in the other half of
the circuit. And further; each half of the
current produces a polar effect, at every point
in the parts of the patient through which it
runs, the same in <i>kind</i>, though differing in
<i>degree</i>, as is produced immediately under the
pole or electrode with which it is connected;
yet an effect antagonistic to that which is produced
under the other pole, or at the corresponding
point in the other half of the current.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF NOTING THE CENTRAL POINT.</h3>

<p>From the above observations, it will be plain
that, when we wish to bring a diseased organ
under the influence of the <i>positive</i> pole, we
must carefully place our electrodes so that
none of the organ, or none of the diseased
part of it, shall appear on the positive<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> side
of the <i>central point of the circuit</i>; it being understood
that the current moves as nearly in
direct lines as the best conducting medium will
admit. Or again, if it be desired to bring a
diseased organ, or any extended part of it,
under the influence of the <i>negative</i> pole, we
must first calculate in placing our electrodes
about where the central point will come, and
then so apply them that no part of the lesion
or disease shall appear on the negative<a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> side
of the central point; otherwise so much of it
as lies on that side will come under the force
of the wrong pole, and thus be affected in a
way the opposite of what was intended. The
characteristic influence of each pole is felt
throughout its own half of the circuit.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h3>DISTINCTIVE USE OF EACH POLE.</h3>

<p>I have said that every disease is preternaturally
either positive or negative. I have
further said, that the application of either pole
to a given part produces an effect the opposite
of what would be produced in the same part by
a reversal of the poles. The way is now prepared
for me to announce <span class="smcapl">THE CENTRAL PRINCIPLE</span>
of our system of practice. The reader
will bear in mind that all acutely inflammatory
or hypersthenic affections are electrically <i>positive</i>
in excess&mdash;having too much vital action&mdash;being
<i>overcharged</i> with the electro-vital fluid;
and that all paralytic diseases, or those of a
sluggish, azo&ouml;dynamic character, are electrically
<i>negative</i>&mdash;having too little electro-vital
fluid&mdash;too little vital action. It is a universal
law of electricity that positives repel each
other, and that negatives repel each other;
but that positives and negatives attract each
other. This is a principle of electric action
everywhere known, where any thing is known
on the subject. <i>We appropriate it practically
to therapeutic purposes.</i> Therefore, when I
wish to repress or repel inflammation, which
is electrically positive in excess, I put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
positive pole to it; or, at least, I bring it under
that half of the circuit with which the positive
pole is connected, and as near to the pole or
electrode as possible. And because two positives
repel each other, and also because the
direction of the current is always from the
positive to the negative pole, carrying the
electro-vital fluid with it, either I must withdraw
my positive electrode, or that excess of
electro-vitality in the diseased part which
makes it morbidly positive, and thus produces
inflammation, must give way. I <i>will not</i> withdraw
my positive pole, and therefore the
positive inflammation <i>must</i> retreat and be
dispersed. In treating this case, I will place
my <i>negative</i> electrode either on some healthy
part, or, if there be perceptible anywhere in
the system a morbidly negative part, as is
often the case, I will place my negative pole
there. For example: if I am treating for
<i>nephritis</i>&mdash;inflammation of the kidneys&mdash;when
I do not perceive any part to be abnormally
negative, I manipulate with my positive electrode
over the inflamed kidney, having the
negative electrode placed at the coccyx&mdash;lowest
part of the spine. My positive pole
repels the positive inflammation from the kidney;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
or, rather, repels from it that excess of
electro-vital fluid which makes it morbidly
positive and induces the inflammation, while
the negative pole attracts the same towards
the coccyx. On its way, it becomes more or
less diverted to adjacent nerves; or, if gathered
in the healthy part, under the negative pole, it
is immediately dispersed by the normal circulation
as soon as the electrode is removed.
But if I find <i>a spinal irritation</i>, say in one or
more of the cervical or dorsal vertebr&aelig;, and,
at the same time, a stomach affected with
<i>chronic dyspepsia</i>, accompanied with <i>constipation
of bowels</i>, I will work over the inflamed
or irritated spine with my positive pole, because
I know from its irritation that there is
an excess of electro-vital fluid in the part,
making it improperly positive; and, with my
negative electrode, I will, at the same time,
treat over the stomach, bowels and liver;
because I know, from the <i>inaction</i> of these
organs, that there is a lack of the vital force&mdash;a
deficiency of the electro-vital fluid&mdash;there,
and that, consequently, they are too negative.
Adopting this method, I accomplish two objects
in the same treatment. <i>First</i>, my positive
pole, applied to the spinal disease, repels from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it the excess of electro-vital fluid which was
there doing mischief; and, <i>second</i>, my negative
pole attracts the same, along with the artificial
or inorganic electricity, to the stomach and
bowels where it is wanted, since negatives
attract positives. Or I wish to rouse to action
a <i>torpid liver</i>. Now, if I find <i>inflammation, or
enlargement</i> of the spleen, as is commonly the
case in <i>chills and fever</i>, I place the positive
pole upon the spleen, at the left side, just
below the false ribs, and the negative pole on
the liver, which is best reached immediately
below the ribs on the right side, and around
backward and upward as far as to the spine.
The positive pole repels the excess of electro-vitality
away from the positive spleen, and so
reduces the improper excitement there, while
at the same time it rushes, by attraction, to
the negative liver, under the negative pole,
and makes that more positive, and so more
active. In this way, I change the polarization
of the parts, and, in so doing, remove the
sustaining cause of the disease. You here
perceive that I treat a positive part with the
positive pole, so as to repel the excess of
electro-vitality from it, and thus repress its
excessive action; and that I treat a negative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
part with the negative pole, so as to attract
the electro-vital fluid, along with the current
from the machine, to it from under the positive
pole, and thus increase the action by
making it more positive.</p>

<p>But suppose I do what nearly all of the doctors
do, who use electricity with any regard to
polarity; that is, if treating acutely inflamed
eyes, for example, apply the negative pole to
the eyes, thinking thereby to make them more
negative; or, if treating amaurosis, apply the
positive electrode to the affected parts, thinking
thereby to make them more positive! I
say, suppose I do this same thing, do you not
see that, by the fixed laws of electricity, I
necessarily increase the evils that I would
remedy? Do you not see that, by placing my
negative pole on the already overcharged and
inflamed eyes, I attract to them yet more of
the electro-vital fluid, and so increase their
positive condition and aggravate the inflammation?
and that, by presenting my positive electrode
to the eyes already more or less paralyzed,
I repel what little electro-vitality there was
there, and so make the nerves all the more
negative and dead? And yet, I repeat it, this
is precisely the plan of almost all the men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
use electricity in therapeutic practice with any
regard to its polarization. They treat a positive
disease&mdash;rather, a <i>hypersthenic</i> disease,
(for they seldom know anything of the <i>electrical</i>
states of diseased parts), with the negative
pole, and an azo&ouml;dynamic disease, which is
negative, with the positive pole!&mdash;all directly
antagonistic to science and success.</p>

<p>But the great mass of physicians, who attempt
to treat electrically, have no knowledge either
of the electrical condition of the various forms
of disease, nor of the distinctive and peculiar
effects produced by either pole of the artificial
current; and consequently all their use of this
powerful agent is entirely empirical&mdash;merely
haphazard experiment.</p>

<p>I may have raised an inquiry a few moments
since which ought to be answered. I said, in
effect, that in treating a positive disease, such,
for instance, as acute, inflammatory rheumatism
or acute pleurisy, I would use the positive
pole on the inflamed parts, and the negative
pole on either some healthy part or on a morbidly
negative part, if I could find such. So,
too, I said I would treat a negative disease,
such as amaurosis or torpidity of liver, with
the negative pole, placing the positive pole on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
either some healthy or morbidly positive part.
The query may have arisen, "By placing the
one pole or the other on a healthy part, do you
not derange the normal electro-vital action
there, disturbing its healthy polarization?" I
answer, yes, for the time being, I do; and if
this disturbing force were to be steadily continued
for any considerable time, the disturbance
would produce manifest and serious
disease. But then, a pole or electrode, placed
on a healthy part, we generally move, or ought
to move, more or less, every few moments,
which prevents the establishment of any perverted
action in the part; and the moment the
electrode is withdrawn, the normal polarization
and healthy action are resumed.</p>

<h3>USE OF THE LONG CORD.</h3>

<p>It is often desirable to bring the entire parts
of the patient, through which the current is
made to pass, under one and the same kind of
influence&mdash;such as shall make them all more
positive or more negative. Especially is this
true in many cases where we wish to run
through but a <i>short</i> space. For this purpose,
there is frequent advantage in using conducting
cords of unequal length. As my views on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this point have been disputed in certain quarters,
I will endeavor here to place them in
such a light that they shall not be rejected for
want of being <i>rightly understood</i>.</p>

<p>I have previously remarked<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> that, for practical
purposes, it is sufficiently exact to consider
the <i>magnetic circuit</i> as extending only
from the <i>positive post</i>, around through the conducting
cords, the electrodes, and the person
of the patient, to the <i>negative post</i>. We will
so regard it at present. This circuit may be
viewed as one continuous magnet, made up of
several sections or shorter magnets placed end
to end&mdash;the positive end of the first to the negative
end of the second, and the positive end
of the second to the negative end of the third.
In this arrangement, the negative end of the
first section is the negative pole of the one
whole magnet, and the positive end of the third
section is the positive pole of the whole magnet.
The minimum quantity of the magnetism
is supposed to be at the negative pole, and the
maximum quantity at the positive pole; and
the quantity is supposed to increase, by <i>regular
graduation</i>, from the negative to the positive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pole. This being so, the quantity is <i>the same</i>
in the positive end of either section and the
negative end of the adjoining section, at their
point of contact.</p>

<p>Now, in practice, the body of the patient, or
so much of it as is embraced between the two
electrodes, may be regarded as the <i>second</i>
section in this magnet; and the cord connected
with the positive post, together with its electrode
attached, may be counted the <i>first</i> and
<i>most negative</i> section; and the cord connected
with the negative post, along with its electrode,
may be the <i>third</i> and <i>most positive</i> section.
And if this whole magnet be more and more
positive, by regular degrees through all the
sections, from its negative to its positive end
or pole, then the nearer any given part of it,
say the <i>second section</i>&mdash;the patient's person,
may be to its positive pole in the negative
post, so much the more <i>positive</i> that section or
part will be. And the nearer such part or
section may be to the negative pole in the
positive post, so much the more <i>negative</i> it
will be. If the cords be of equal length, the
central point in the circuit or magnet will be
in the second section&mdash;the person of the patient,
midway between the electrodes; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
section will be charged with the <i>mean</i> quantity
of the magnetic fluid. The <i>central point</i> will
hold <i>exactly</i> the mean quantity. But if the
cord in the <i>first</i> section be <i>two</i> yards long, and
that in the <i>third</i> section be <i>four</i> yards, then
section second&mdash;the patient's parts under treatment&mdash;will
be nearest to the <i>negative</i> pole in
the positive post, and consequently will be
charged with much <i>less</i> than the mean quantity
of the fluid, and will therefore be made so
much the more <i>negative</i>. If, on the other hand,
the cord in section <i>first</i> be <i>four</i> yards in length,
and that in section <i>third</i> be only <i>two</i> yards,
then the patient's body&mdash;section second&mdash;will
be brought nearest to the <i>positive</i> pole in the
negative post, and of course be charged with
much <i>more</i> than the mean quantity of the
magnetic fluid, and hence will be made so much
the more <i>positive</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that the positive and negative
poles of section second&mdash;the parts of the patient
between the electrodes&mdash;will not be <i>reversed</i>
by any such changes in the length or relative
positions of the conducting cords; nor is such
reversal required in those cases where the use
of the <i>long cord</i> is indicated. The only change
of polarization called for in such cases, is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<i>all</i> the parts through which the current is to
pass should, in greater or less degree, be
affected alike, as being made more positive or
more negative. Of course these parts will be
so affected in different degrees&mdash;those nearest
to the <i>short</i> cord the <i>most</i>; those nearest to
the <i>long</i> cord the <i>least</i>.</p>

<p>The class of cases where the use of the <i>long
cord</i> is more especially advantageous, comprises
those in which it is desirable to run the current
<i>out</i> of the patient at the shortest admissible
distance from the positive electrode. For example,
in treating <i>cynanche tonsillaris</i>, (quinsy),
if treating with the positive pole in the mouth,
we would not wish to run the current further
than to the back of the neck; or, if treating
externally, we would not wish to carry the
negative electrode further from the positive
than from side to side. Here the <i>long cord</i>,
with the negative electrode, would be a special
advantage in subduing the inflammation. We
would not care to <i>increase</i> the inflammatory
action, as we should necessarily do on the positive
side of the central point, by using cords
of <i>equal</i> length.</p>

<p>Again, if treating a case of acute <i>enteritis</i>&mdash;inflammation
of the intestines&mdash;we would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wish, while treating the abdomen with the positive
pole, to increase the inflammation in the
lower parts, by using equal cords and placing
the negative pole at the sacrum or the coccyx.
Neither would we wish to reduce the strength
of the lower limbs by carrying the negative
pole to the feet. Nor, yet again, would we
care to endanger the thoracic viscera by running
the current from the abdomen up to the
dorsal or cervical vertebr&aelig;. The true way, in
such a case, would be to connect the negative
electrode with a <i>long cord</i>, and then to run the
current through the inflamed parts, and <i>out</i>
somewhere from the lumbar vertebr&aelig; to the
coccyx, by treating over the abdomen with
the positive pole, and placing the negative
pole on the lower parts of the spine.</p>

<p>As the cords that accompany the machine
from the manufacturer are usually cut about
two yards in length, every practitioner should
supply himself with an extra cord, of at least
three yards, to be used as the <i>long cord</i>.</p>

<h3>THE INWARD AND THE OUTWARD CURRENT.</h3>

<p>I have already said that when the conducting-cords
are of equal length, as for the most
part they should be, the central point of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
circuit will be in the person of the patient,
about midway between the two electrodes.
Now, since the current always runs from the
positive to the negative pole, and makes its
whole circuit in that direction, it will be readily
seen that, from the place on the patient
where the positive pole is applied, inward as
far as to the central point, the direction of the
current may properly be said to be <i>inward</i>;
and that, from the central point to the place of
the negative electrode, where the current comes
out, its direction may be said to be <i>outward</i>.
When, therefore, a part is treated with the
positive pole, or when the part under treatment
appears anywhere between the positive
pole and the central point, it is not unusual to
say, It is treated with the <i>inward current</i>.
And when a part is treated with the negative
pole, or when it appears between the central
point and the negative pole, it is often
spoken of as being treated with the <i>outward
current</i>.</p>

<h3>MECHANICAL EFFECT OF EACH POLE.</h3>

<p>The <i>mechanical</i> effect of the forward end of
the current, or that part of it which is under
the negative electrode, is to relax, expand and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
weaken; while that of the rear end, under the
positive electrode, is to contract and strengthen.
A moving ship disperses the waters at its bow,
but draws them in at its stern. The bullet shot
from a gun, in passing through a plank, leaves
the perforation closed where it enters in, but
wide open where it comes out. Thus, in
physics, the advance end of a moving body
tends to disperse the element through which it
is passing, while the rear end tends to its contraction.
Analogous to this are the <i>mechanical</i>
effects of the different ends of an electrical
current in the living tissue. When, therefore,
we wish to relax a muscle that is unnaturally
contracted, as by rheumatism or otherwise, we
must bring it under the forward end&mdash;the outward
current&mdash;the negative pole. If we desire
to contract ligaments or muscles that are
abnormally relaxed, (not <i>atrophied</i>), as in
prolapsus uteri, we must subject them to the
rear end of the current&mdash;the positive pole.
Parts that are unnaturally contracted are electrically
negative in excess, and need to be
made more positive. And parts that are unhealthily
relaxed are too positive, and should
be made more negative. We make a part
more positive by applying to it the negative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
pole, and more negative by applying to it the
positive pole. Parts <i>spasmodically</i> contracted
are acute and positive; those <i>permanently</i> contracted
are chronic and negative.</p>

<h3>RELAXED AND ATROPHIED CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>I alluded, above, to a distinction between a
<i>relaxed</i> and an <i>atrophied</i> condition of an organ.
There is such a distinction, which should be
carefully observed while treating parts so
affected. An atrophied muscle or organ becomes
soft and flabby from lack of nourishment. But
this condition is not properly one of <i>relaxation</i>.
It is rather a diminution&mdash;a <i>thinning out</i> of
atoms, by wasting without replenishment. Such
a condition is always negative, and requires
treatment under the negative pole. On the
contrary, relaxed parts, such as appear in prolapsus
uteri, and in the sagging down of the
diaphragm, with the thoracic and abdominal
viscera, exhibit no lack of nutrition or of vital
action. Relaxation is a <i>loosening</i> of atoms from
each other, more or less, without loss of aggregate
weight; and implies a condition electrically
positive in excess, and calls for treatment
with the positive pole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS OF THE CURRENT.</h3>

<p><i>Negative</i> affections, as a general rule, are
best treated with the <i>upward-running</i> current&mdash;the
positive pole being placed at a lower point
than the negative. <i>Inflammatory</i> affections,
and other <i>plus</i> conditions, for the most part,
should be treated with the down-running current,
keeping the negative pole at a lower
point than the positive. But these rules admit
of frequent exceptions, which every practitioner's
experience will soon reveal.</p>

<p>The <i>downward</i> current, running <i>with</i> the
downward and outward course of the nerves,
tends to <i>depletion</i> and <i>weakness</i>, for the reason
that it <i>runs off</i> from the system the electro-vital
fluid. The <i>upward</i> current, on the other hand,
running <i>against</i> the nerves, inward towards
their source, feeds the system with fresh electricity,
and gives a <i>tonic</i> effect. Yet for this
purpose, it must not be too long continued, nor
of too severe strength, lest it overtask and irritate
the nerve-sheaths.</p>

<p>In treating a <i>paralyzed</i> organ, the current
should commonly be run from a <i>healthy</i> part,
whether that require it to be directed downwards
or upwards. For example: In treating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a paralyzed foot or leg, the positive pole should
be upon the lower part of the spine&mdash;at the
coccyx&mdash;or even under the sole of the opposite
foot. It is best to alternate between these
positions. So in treating a paralyzed hand or
arm, let the current be run from the upper
part of the spine, and frequently also from the
opposite hand. With the <i>negative</i> electrode,
treat all over the paralyzed parts. Yet it is
well, in these cases, often to <i>reverse</i> the direction
of the current for a brief period at the
close of the sittings, say one to two minutes,
for the purpose of rousing the nervous susceptibility,
and to prevent exhaustion from too
continuously running off the electro-vital fluid.</p>

<h3>TREATING WITH ELECTROLYTIC CURRENTS.</h3>

<p>For decomposing and carrying off unnatural
growths, as fistula, ficus, glandular enlargements
and other tumors, it is often best to
dilute the <i>electrolytic</i> quality of the galvanic
current A B with one or both of the Faradaic
currents, as by taking A C or A D instead of
A B. But <i>malignant</i> and <i>poisonous</i> affections,
as scirrhus and other varieties of cancer, and
also cases of infectious virus, demand continually,
or with but occasional exceptions, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
primary galvanic current A B. &#9758;In treating
these malignant affections, the current
should be run through as short a distance of
<i>healthy</i> tissue as possible, yet so as fairly to
reach the diseased part. And whether this
part be brought, for a given time, under the
one pole or the other, the opposite pole should
be attached to the <i>long cord</i>, so as to throw the
central point of the circuit, not in the person
of the patient, but out on the long cord, thus
bringing the entire organic parts though which
the current is passed on one and the same side
of the center, and so, under the ruling influence
of the same pole.</p>

<p>Those diseases which require the chemical
or electrolytic currents should, for the most
part, be treated under the negative pole, particularly
those which need the galvanic current
A B, and also old ulcers and <i>chronic
irritation of mucus surfaces</i>. Glandular enlargements
not of scirrhous character, and
excrescent growths not poisonous, may often
be reduced, and perhaps sometimes cured,
under the positive pole. But my own experience,
even with these affections, is that it is
better to treat them under the negative pole
until they come to assume, as sometimes they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
will, an <i>acute</i> state, when the positive pole may
be used with success. If, however, it appears
desirable to produce a <i>cauterizing</i> effect, this
must be done by persistent treatment under the
negative pole of a strong A B or A C current,
and, if the disease be external, with a small
pointed electrode.</p>

<h3>POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE MANIFESTATIONS.</h3>

<p><i>Acute</i> diseases are to be regarded as electrically
positive, and <i>chronic</i> affections as negative.
The exceptions are rare, if any at all.
<i>Malignant cholera</i>, which is eminently acute,
might by some be considered as an exception.
In negative diseases, there is a low degree of
electro-vitality. And it has been remarked by
careful observers, particularly in the Orient,
that cholera rages with greatest destructiveness
when no special electric phenomena have
for long time appeared in the atmosphere, and
when the artificial electrical apparatus could
be made to yield its sparks only with difficulty,
or not at all. And again, after a thunderstorm,
when the electric machine works again
freely, the cholera is also found to abate quickly,
and sometimes very greatly. The inference
drawn from these facts has been that the prevalence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of cholera is largely owing to a lack
of electricity in the atmosphere, and consequently
to a want of the animal electricity or
electro-vitality in the system of the patient;
and thence it might be concluded that cholera
implies a negative condition of the system. I
think there is a fallacy in this reasoning. There
appears to me to be an unwarrantable assumption
in confidently attributing the long absence
from the heavens of marked electrical phenomena,
and the failure of the electric machine
to give its spark, to an unquestioned deficiency
of atmospheric electricity. Electrical manifestations
take place only when the <i>plus</i> and
<i>minus</i> conditions are existing, in relation to
each other, somewhat near, or not very remote;
and the visible phenomena appear when the
positive and negative rush together, so as to
produce a polar equilibrium. But suppose a
<i>plus</i> condition to exist over a wide region,
then, everything being <i>overcharged</i>, the visible
phenomena would be as rare and as difficult of
attainment as if all around were negative.
How, then, can it be inferred, with any certainty,
from such data, that there is a <i>deficiency</i>
of electricity, rather than an <i>excess</i> of it?</p>

<p>I have not treated a case of cholera; but my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
own impression of it is, that in the first stage,
or during the "rice-water" discharges, the
condition of the system is, as in other acute
affections, excessively positive; but that, as the
collapse comes on, it rapidly subsides into an
intensely negative state, thus assuming the
chief characteristic of a chronic condition.</p>

<p>In the above remarks, I would not be understood
to indicate any doubt that the prevalence
of cholera is often aggravated or mitigated by
peculiar electrical states of the atmosphere. It
appears altogether probable that such may be
the fact; and I should presume that electrical
treatment, properly administered, would be found
eminently successful in this fearful malady.</p>

<p>Again, in <i>chronic rheumatism</i> there might,
at first view, seem to be frequent exceptions
to the rule last above stated; but the cases
alluded to are not such. It is often the fact,
during chronic rheumatism, that soreness and
severe pain are felt, especially under the presentation
of the negative pole, thus showing
that these points require to be treated with the
positive pole. But, in such cases, although
the general disease of the system be chronic
and negative, these sore and severely painful
points have, for the time, risen in their electro-vital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
condition, and so become acute and
positive. But when chronic rheumatism is
attended with only a <i>dull</i> pain, and that chiefly
under exercise of the parts, and with little or
no increase of pain under an application of the
negative pole of the A D current, medium
strength, and with no swelling, then the pain,
the stiffness and the lameness are all marks of
the negative state, and the parts must be treated
with the negative pole of the A D current,
<i>strongly</i> at first, but diminishing in force, from
time to time, as the patient becomes relieved.</p>

<p><i>Alkaline</i> affections&mdash;those causing excessive
alkaline secretions&mdash;are electrically positive.
<i>Acid</i> or <i>acidulous</i> states are negative.</p>

<h3>HEALING.</h3>

<p>For healing wounds, burns, ulcers, irritation
of mucous membranes, and cutaneous eruptions,
the A D current is by far the best.
<i>Recent</i> wounds, contusions and burns are electrically
positive. <i>Old</i> ulcers and irritations
are generally negative.</p>

<h3>DIAGNOSIS.</h3>

<p>To make a correct diagnosis, it is needful to
bear in mind the following general principles:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Where the organism is in health, the momentary
application to the patient of the negative
pole of the double Faradaic current B
D&mdash;the best for diagnostic use&mdash;in good medium
strength,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> will be directly felt, yet will cause
no pain. Whatever <i>muscular contractions</i> may
be produced for the time, they are harmless,
and need not be noticed. Wherever the electro-vital
fluid is in <i>excess</i>, producing hypersthenia&mdash;too
much vital action&mdash;the part is
morbidly <i>positive</i>; and, excepting sometimes in
the stomach and bowels, the B D current, of
medium force, directed to that part under the
negative pole, will produce <i>sharp pain</i>. But
where a current of full medium strength can
not be felt under the negative pole, there is a
morbidly negative state&mdash;a deficiency of vital
action&mdash;a condition of at least partial paralysis&mdash;an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>2. In a state of health, different persons will
have different degrees of sensibility to the electric
current, depending on their varied nervous
susceptibility. Again, the same person will be
much less sensitive to the current when directed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to the spine, particularly the lower part of it,
and to the stomach, than when directed to most
other parts. Also, where bones lie near the
surface, the periosteum&mdash;the membrane immediately
investing the bone&mdash;is apt to feel more
sensibly under the electrodes than the muscular
parts. But these variations soon become so
familiar to the practitioner that he finds no
difficulty in making the proper allowances for
them.</p>

<p>In making an electrical examination, the
two following questions present themselves to
be answered: First, whether anywhere, and,
if so, where is there a morbid electrical state
in the body of this patient? Second, what is
the electrical condition of that unhealthy part?
Is it <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>?</p>

<p>These questions being answered, according
to the tests just given, the well-instructed practitioner
is prepared to go on and treat the
patient judiciously, and with success, if success
be attainable by any form of medication.</p>

<p>Let me next say, It is best, as a general
rule, to make examinations with the <i>negative
pole</i>. The reason of this is that, since the current
is always more energetic under the negative
than under the positive pole, it makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
itself more sensibly <i>felt</i> there than under the
positive pole. Indeed, it will commonly be felt
even to <i>painfulness</i> there, if the part were overcharged
and inflamed before. Thus, under the
negative electrode, the current readily detects
any active disease. But, if we be making the
examination with the <i>positive pole</i>, as we come
upon any point more or less inflamed, the current,
quick as lightning, rushes away from such
inflamed part to the part under the stationary
negative pole, carrying with it, for the time
being, more or less of that excess of electro-vital
fluid which was in force at the inflamed
point; so that <i>no pain</i>, perhaps, is experienced
there; and thus the disease escapes detection.</p>

<p>I am aware that it has been said by some of
our practitioners, with, if I rightly remember,
the able discoverer of the grand practical principles
of our system, Prof. C. H. Bolles, at their
head, that it is not quite prudent to use the
negative pole in hand for diagnosis, lest we
possibly contract the disease from the patient;
since, in that case, the current runs from the
patient to the practitioner. They think it safer
to use the positive pole in hand; so letting the
current run from the practitioner to the patient.
There is force in this consideration, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
doubt, where the patient is affected with a poisonous
or malignant disease. And where any
thing of this nature is apprehended, I would
never examine with the negative pole in hand.
But these cases are commonly so manifest, or
so easily determined by colloquial inquiry, that
examination with the electric current is rarely
if ever necessary. And when the disease is
plainly not of a poisonous or infectious nature,
I do not think there is any danger to be apprehended
from the cause stated. I therefore
prefer, as a general rule, to examine with the
negative pole; and for the reason given above.</p>

<p>The temperature of the room and the adjustment
of apparel should be the same as for
treatment. To prevent improper chilliness, the
room ought to be of such temperature that
clothing is not required for bodily comfort&mdash;say,
from 70 to 80 degrees, <i>Fahrenheit</i>. Seat
the patient on a stool or chair, (a stool is most
convenient), and yourself at his side, with your
machine, ready for use, on a table or bench
before him, and a vessel of warm water within
easy reach. If the patient be a man we let his
trunk be disrobed, giving free access to the
back, chest and abdomen. If the patient be a
woman, let her be covered with a treating-robe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of which garments the practitioner should keep
a supply. They are made much like a lady's
plain nightgown; but large and loose, so as to
serve ladies of any size, and give ample room
to work the electrodes under them. Her skirts
should be dropped <i>below the seat</i>, so far that
their bands shall lie across her lap.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose the machine to be
working. We will take the B D current. Let
it be of good medium strength. We regulate
the strength by the quantity of fluid in the battery,
so far as <i>volume</i> is concerned, and by
means of the plunger as respects <i>intensity</i>.
The electrodes should be dampened with warm
water. Let the <i>sponge-roll</i>, [a very thin expansion
of sponge, quilted upon a muslin lining,
and enveloping one of the tin electrodes],
be made the positive pole, and be placed under
the coccyx&mdash;lowest part of the spine. Then
attach the <i>positive</i> cord; that is, the cord connected
with the <i>negative</i> post, to another sponge-roll,
to be held in the operator's right hand;
or, what is better, attach it to a thin, flexible,
metallic wristband, (brass is good, but metallic
lace&mdash;such as is used in trimming <i>regalia</i>, is
best), underlaid with wet muslin, and fastened
around the right wrist. This brings the operator's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hand into the circuit as the negative electrode
or pole. Next, pass a moist, warm
sponge all over the patient's back. Now, before
the back becomes dry, press the points of two
fingers firmly, yet not uncomfortably, upon the
back of the neck at the base of the skull;
thence move gradually downward, by frequent
touches of the same firm but gentle character,
keeping one finger on each side of the
spinous processes, until the whole length of the
spine has been, in this manner, passed over.
If sharp pain or soreness be felt at any point,
<i>note</i> that point; there is inflamed irritation
there. Then return up to the right or left
shoulder, and pass, in like manner, by frequent
touches with one or two fingers, over all parts
of the back on that side of the spine, down to
the hips. Then, in the same way, examine
the shoulder and back on the other side of the
spine, noting, as before, every point, if there
be any, where soreness and pain appear. After
this, pass over the entire neck, then over the
front parts of the thorax and abdomen, down
to the pelvic bones, everywhere watching for
soreness and pain. Next, go to the head. Wet
the hair through to the scalp, (because dry
hair is a bad conductor,) and change to a <i>very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
soft</i> B C current. Then go over all the head
in the same manner as over the neck and
trunk. Better <i>reverse</i> the poles on the head,
by transposing the cords in the posts, so as to
make the manipulating hand the <i>positive</i> pole.
The head is, or ought to be, extremely sensitive.
You need not do this, however, if the
negative pole can be received on the head
without discomfort, as it sometimes can be.
Commence on the cerebrum, and then pass to
the cerebellum.</p>

<p>If, in the examination of the spine, the practitioner
finds it uncomfortable to bear in his
fingers a current of sufficient strength to be
distinctly felt in that part of the patient, he
may use the side-sponge cup on the spine. But
let him <i>never use a current on another person</i>
which he does not first apply to his own nerves,
so as to know its intensity. Indeed, if one prefer
to use the side-sponge cup through the
whole process, he can do so; although there is
advantage in using the fingers, since, by their
concentrated impressions, he is more sure to detect
disease than by the broader face of the
sponge cup.</p>

<p>&#9758;Now, wherever there is found <i>soreness</i>
or <i>lancinating pain</i> under the touch, it is sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that the part is preternaturally <i>positive</i>&mdash;more
or less so, according to the degree of painful
irritability. On the other hand, if there be
found a part evincing much <i>less</i> than the usual
sensibility found in the <i>healthy</i> corresponding
part of other patients, it may safely be pronounced
torpid or paralytic, more or less. It
lacks sufficient electro-vitality&mdash;is improperly
<i>negative</i>, and needs to be treated with the negative
pole.</p>

<p>It will often happen that diseased action is
found in parts where the patient was entirely
unaware of its existence until the practitioner's
fingers or other electrode revealed it. Again,
it will sometimes be found that there is no disease
whatever in parts where the patient supposed
disease to be active. But when we find
patients to be especially nervous, it is not always
best to tell them immediately just what our examinations
have revealed to us&mdash;how severely
or how little we think them diseased. It is
sometimes better to humor, more or less, the patient's
own views for a time; lest, by exciting
him or her, we make a difficult case out of one
that might have been mastered with comparative
ease. In this matter discretion should
guide us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>But let me say farther, what I deeply feel,
that neither do I think it right to <i>persistently</i>
conceal from patients, especially those who are
dangerously affected, a knowledge of their true
condition. In my opinion, physicians often
unwittingly incur an awful responsibility in
this way, wronging their patients in the most
vital and momentous of all interests&mdash;the interests
involved in a due preparation for death.
I believe the true way, in every such case, is
for the physician himself, in a kind and soothing
manner, to reveal to the patient, little by
little, if need be, what he really thinks, or to
ask the patient's pastor, or some other calm
and judicious person to do it for him. I believe
the visits of a discreet and affectionate
pastor, or, in the absence of a pastor, of some
other mild and Christian friend, to the bedside
of the sick is, nine times in ten, not only no
embarrassment to the patient's recovery, but
positively favorable to it, and ought to be
habitually encouraged, rather than restrained,
by medical practitioners.</p>

<h2>PRESCRIPTIONS.</h2>

<h3>PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The author wishes to caution the reader not
to rely merely on the forms of treatment here
prescribed, but to study thoroughly the principles
taught in the preceding pages, until he
shall have mastered them, and can judge for
himself of the correctness of these prescriptions.
It should be remembered, however, that
the diseases here considered are viewed in their
<i>simple</i> or <i>uncomplicated</i> states. Where complications
exist, the treatment must be modified
according to the judgment of the practitioner.</p>

<p>In these instructions, it is always to be understood
that the treatment prescribed is with
<i>cords of equal length</i>, except when the <i>long
cord</i> is especially mentioned.</p>

<p>In most of the local diseases here named,
particularly those which are electrically <i>negative</i>,
it is desirable to supplement the local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
treatment prescribed with occasional <i>general
tonic</i> treatment, where, in the judgment of the
practitioner, it can be given without detriment
to the local affection.</p>

<p>In all treatments, the electrodes should be
moistened with warm water.</p>

<h3>GENERAL TONIC TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>Take the B D current, (A D is very good),
of fair medium strength. Place the sponge-roll,
N. P. [Negative Pole], at the coccyx&mdash;lowest
point of spine&mdash;and manipulate with
side-sponge cup, P. P. [Positive Pole], from
the feet all over the lower limbs to and about
the hips; occupying three or four minutes, or
less. Then remove the N. P., substituting for
the sponge-roll the end-sponge cup, and place
this upon the spine at the lower part of the
neck. Now manipulate with side-sponge cup,
P. P., over the trunk generally, from the lower
to the upper parts; giving special attention to
the spinal column by treating it somewhat more
than other parts. Treat the trunk some five to
eight minutes. Next, keeping the N. P. still
upon the back of the neck, treat with P. P.
over the hands and arms, up to and about the
shoulders. Treat here two or three minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been customary, for the most part, in
giving general tonic treatment, to make the
P. P. stationary&mdash;placing it successively at the
feet, the coccyx and the hands&mdash;and to manipulate
above it with the N. P. But the better
way is as directed above. The object is to
reinforce the main nerve-lines and centers with
electricity from without. The nerves branch off
from their centers&mdash;the brain, the spinal cord,
the ganglions, and the great plexuses&mdash;and run,
in general, downward and outward from the
trunk lines, in a manner somewhat analogous
to the branches and twigs of an inverted little
tree. If we place before us such a shrub, with
the root upward and the branches pointing
downwards, and then draw lines from the
lowest point of the lowest twig to the outer
ends of all the branches surrounding the main
trunk, we shall see that our lines, instead of
running in the general directions of the limbs,
will, for the most part, run <i>across</i> the twigs.
But, if we draw our lines from the outer extremities
of the branches and twigs up to the
root, or near to the source of the trunk, we
will find the lines, in the main, running nearly
parallel with the branches. Now, let us substitute
for this inverted tree the nervous system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of a man, and remember that the electric current
moves from the positive to the negative
pole as nearly in straight lines as it can where
there are good conductors, such as the nerves
and muscles, and it will at once appear that,
in treating the lower limbs, if we place our N.
P. at the coccyx, and then manipulate with
P. P. over the feet and legs, our electric lines
are running from all the surface extremities of
the nerve ramifications, wherever the P. P. is
moving, directly into and along these fine ramifications,
and, through the larger nerve-branches,
up to the stationary N. P. Or, if we
treat the <i>trunk</i> of the body by placing the
N. P. on the spine, near its upper end, and
then manipulate with P. P. from the lower
part upward over the back, sides, abdomen
and chest, our current strikes into the surface
extremities of the nerves at every point where
the electrode touches, and makes its way upwards,
along the nerve-lines, to the great spinal
cord under the N. P.&mdash;thus replenishing with
fresh electricity all the ganglions, plexuses and
nerve-trunks along the way. But if P. P. be
made stationary at the lower end of the section
under treatment, and we manipulate over the
parts with the N. P., the current strikes from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
P. P., across the nerve branches and comes
out at their surface extremities wherever the
negative electrode moves&mdash;so reaching but
indirectly and imperfectly the trunk-lines and
their centers.</p>

<h3>COMMON COLDS.</h3>

<p>Take the B D Faradaic current&mdash;moderate
strength. If the affection be mainly in the
head, give,</p>

<p><i>1st.</i> <i>A face bath.</i> Let an earthen wash-basin,
nearly filled with tepid water, be placed
on a table or chair before the patient, he holding
the sponge-roll [see page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>] N. P. in his
hands. Now let him bury his face in the water
as long as he can hold his breath. At the
instant after his face is in the water, drop into
the water the tin electrode P. P. Repeat this
process as often as he recovers his breath,
some eight, ten or a dozen times.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i> Place the sponge-roll N. P. in the hands
as before, and, making an electrode P. P. of
your own hand, in the manner directed for
<i>diagnosis</i>, clasp the nose of the patient between
your thumb and finger, moving them up and
down along the sides of the nose, and on the
nose between the eyes, about five minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Repeat the above forms twice or thrice a day.</p>

<p>If there be hoarseness, or cough, or stricture
of lungs, or soreness of chest, place N. P.,
with <i>long cord</i>, upon back of neck, and treat
with P. P. over the front part of neck and
breast, and wherever upon the thorax stricture
or soreness appears.</p>

<p>If there be a feverish condition of the system,
attended, perhaps, with pain in the head,
place P. P. on the spine, a little below the
cranium, and treat with N. P., <i>long cord</i>, all
the way down the spine, and over the entire
back, sides, thorax and abdomen. In this case
let the current be rather mild, and be continued
for a considerable length of time, with
the view of bringing out perspiration. It is
<i>best</i> that the patient should receive treatment
in bed, perfectly protected from any cool air
that might restrain or check perspiration. In
these cases, I not unfrequently treat with a
light B D current a full hour, unless perspiration
start freely in shorter time, working over
the trunk and limbs generally. But, while
treating over the lower limbs, the P. P. should
be upon the hypogastric flexus, at the "small
of the back." Treat once or twice a day until
relief appears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>After the stricture and soreness of the lungs
are removed, and the general febrile action is
suppressed, it is desirable to give a <i>general
tonic treatment</i>.</p>

<h3>CEPHALAGIA. (<i>Headache.</i>)</h3>

<p>1. "<i>Nervous headache.</i>" Take the B D
current&mdash;moderate force. Place P. P. on back
of neck, just below the brain, and manipulate
with side-sponge cup, N. P., all the way down
the spine and over the back.</p>

<p>It may often be necessary to apply the P. P.
directly to the suffering part of the head. In
that case, take the soft Faradaic current B C.
If the fluid in the battery cell be fresh, use
very little&mdash;just enough to reach well the platina
plate and make the machine run. Wet
the hair thoroughly through to the scalp, where
the electrode is to be applied. Seat the patient
on N. P., or let him hold it in both his
hands, (the former is the better way), and treat
lightly over the affected parts of the head with
P. P. Treat five to ten minutes, as may be
required, and if the pain returns, repeat the
treatment. Only a very light current can be
safely applied directly to the brain, and that
an <i>induced</i> Faradaic current.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Sick Headache.</i> The <i>procuring</i> cause of
this distressing disease is involved in considerable
mystery. It seems, however, to be largely
dependent on the secretion and discharge into
the duodenum of an improper quantity of bile,
and an irregularity in the peristaltic action of
the upper part of the bowels, particularly of
the duodenum, in which that action more or
less is <i>reversed</i>, and thereby throws the biliary
fluid up, through the pylorus, into the stomach.
After a time, the stomach becomes nauseated
by its accumulation; and the head, through
nervous sympathy, is rendered electrically
positive in excess, and thus is made to ache.
Yet there are certain characteristics of the
disease which this view does not satisfactorily
explain, and which must remain unexplained
until advancing science shall reveal to us more
perfect light.</p>

<p>When this disease has become habitual and
periodic, it is very obstinate, and requires persistent
treatment&mdash;often for several months.</p>

<p>Take the B D current, with moderate force.
Place the N. P. on the spine, immediately
above the kidneys, and treat with P. P. over
the stomach and the duodenum, (lying transversely
just below the stomach), three to five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
minutes. Treat in this manner about twice a
week.</p>

<p>It may sometimes be necessary to treat the
head directly. If so, after the treatment above
prescribed, add that prescribed for the head
directly, in <i>nervous</i> headache, with this difference,
viz: instead of seating the patient on the
N. P., or placing the same in his hands, pass
it over the stomach and duodenum, unless the
former may be already too positive. In that
case, let the N. P. be at the seat.</p>

<h3>DEAFNESS.</h3>

<p><i>The prognosis</i> is very uncertain. This infirmity
is often cured by our system, even
when of long standing; and often, again, the
treatment fails. The uncertainty arises from
the difficulty in determining the exact pathological
derangement.</p>

<p>Take the A D current, mild force. Introduce
the ear electrode as the N. P. when the
disease is of long standing, or as the P. P.
when it is of recent origin. Apply the opposite
pole to the back of the neck. Treat five
to eight minutes, once a day for three or four
days, and afterwards three times a week. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
no success appears within three weeks, it will
probably be vain to expect it afterwards.</p>

<h3>NOISES IN THE HEAD.</h3>

<p>Treat the same as for deafness.</p>

<h3>INFLAMED EYES.</h3>

<p>If the disease be recent and acute, (but not
infectious), as from sewing or reading by lamp
light or other irritation, take the C D current,
of moderate force. Treat with the eye-bath,
filled with tepid water, having the eye open in
the water. Make the bath the P. P., and
place the N. P. on the spine at the upper dorsal
vertebra. Treat each eye three minutes daily.</p>

<p>If the disease be acute and <i>infectious</i>, use
the A C current some four to six times, and
then change to A D. Apply the current as
directed above.</p>

<p>If the disease be chronic, or the lids granulated,
treat with A D, <i>very mild</i> current, applying
the eye-bath, N. P., to the eyes, and
place the P. P. upon the spine, at the top of
the back. Treat each eye three to five minutes
three times a week.</p>

<p>In cases of simple inflammation, (not infectious),
and that chiefly or entirely in the lids,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it is often quite as well or better to treat over
the closed lids with the finger, holding the
sponge-roll P. P. in the same hand.</p>

<h3>AMAUROSIS. (<i>Paralysis of the optic nerve.</i>)</h3>

<p>Use B D current, moderate force, three or
four times, and then change to C D. Apply
the eye-bath, N. P., to the eye, and sponge-cup
P. P. upon one of the upper dorsal vertebr&aelig;.
Treat three to five minutes on each eye,
three times a week.</p>

<h3>STRABISMUS. (<i>Discordance of the eyes.</i>)</h3>

<p>If neither of the <i>rectus</i> muscles have been
cut and cicatrized, and if the deformity be not
congenital, it may ordinarily be cured.</p>

<p>Take B D current, with small pointed electrodes.
If the eye be turned <i>inward</i>, insert
P. P. in the outer angle of the eye, so as to
bear upon the <i>rectus externus</i>, and N. P. in the
inner angle, so as to bear on the <i>rectus internus</i>.
Let the current be of what force the
patient can bear. Withdraw the electrodes
frequently, to rest the eye, and then reapply
them. Apply the current in this manner six
to ten or twelve times at a sitting. The eye
will soon become inflamed, but the inflammation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
will quickly go down. Treat daily, or on
alternate days, as the eye can bear. After
treating some ten or twelve times, if the organ
does not come into place let it rest a week,
and then resume the treatment as before.</p>

<p>If the eye be turned <i>outward</i>, treat in the
same manner as directed above, except that in
this case, the P. P. must be inserted in the
<i>inner</i> and the N. P. in the <i>outer</i> angle.</p>

<h3>CATARRH. (<i>Acute.</i>)</h3>

<p>If in the head, treat as prescribed for common
colds in the head. If in the throat, place
N. P. somewhere on the dorsal vertebr&aelig;, and
treat with P. P.&mdash;tongue instrument&mdash;in the
mouth about five minutes, and then with end-sponge
cup externally upon the affected parts
as much longer. Use the B D current, in
good medium strength, twice a day.</p>

<h3>CATARRH. (<i>Chronic.</i>)</h3>

<p>If in the head, first give <i>face-bath</i>, as in
common colds, except with <i>reversed poles</i> and
changing to the A D current, <i>very mild</i> force.
If in the throat or bronchial tubes, place the
P. P. of the A D current, with <i>long cord</i>, on
the back of the neck or in the mouth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
treat with N. P., <i>soft</i> current, upon the affected
parts, eight or ten minutes.</p>

<p>Repeat treatment about three times a week.</p>

<h3>DIPHTHERIA.</h3>

<p>Use the A D current, strong force. Place
the N. P., <i>long cord</i>, upon the lower cervical
vertebr&aelig;, and then treat, <i>first</i>, with the <i>tongue</i>
instrument, P. P., in the mouth, as far back
on the tongue as can be borne, three to five
minutes. <i>Next</i>, manipulate with sponge-cup,
P. P., or the tin electrode filled with sponge,
over all the front parts of the neck and throat,
down to the chest, five to eight minutes.</p>

<p>Treat as often as once in two or three hours.</p>

<h3>APHONIA. (<i>Loss of voice.</i>)</h3>

<p>This affection requires treatment variously,
as it depends on one or another procuring
cause.</p>

<p>If it be the result of recent "cold," inducing
acute catarrhal irritation in the larynx, treat
<i>first</i> as for <i>common cold</i>, and <i>close</i> the sitting
as follows: Place N. P., <i>long cord</i>, of A D current,
in good medium force, upon back of
neck or in the mouth, and treat three to five
minutes, twice a day, with P. P., over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
front parts of the air pipe in the neck; mostly
over the <i>larynx</i>&mdash;Adam's apple.</p>

<p>If it be from paralysis of the larynx, treat
with B D current, rather strong force; placing
P. P., <i>long cord</i>, on back of neck or in the
mouth, and work with N. P. over the <i>larynx</i>,
and somewhat over the air tube of the
neck generally. Treat three to five minutes,
daily.</p>

<p>If, as is sometimes the case, the difficulty
proceeds from a relaxation of the diaphragm,
with general sagging down of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, so as to draw upon the
trachea, then treat the whole trunk tonically,
using the B D current. Place the N. P. low
on back of neck, and treat with P. P. over
the abdomen and thorax, and especially all
around the edge of the diaphragm&mdash;along the
lower line of the false ribs. Treat with medium
strength of current, ten minutes, three
times a week. The aim is to contract all the
relaxed parts, so to relieve the larynx from
the strain upon it.</p>

<h3>CROUP.</h3>

<p>Treat croup, whether membranous or spasmodic,
much the same as is prescribed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
diphtheria, only, in the latter part of the form,
treat less.</p>

<h3>ASTHMA.</h3>

<p>Use the A D current, medium force. Treat
with P. P. over the shoulders and between the
scapul&aelig;, and with N. P. in front upon the
lungs, heart and diaphragm. Treat five to ten
minutes, daily, for three or four days; after
that, three times a week.</p>

<h3>HEPATIZATION OF LUNGS.</h3>

<p>Take A D current, pretty strong force.
Treat in front, over the lungs, with P. P.,
moving N. P., <i>long cord</i>, on spine from neck
to near the kidneys; that is, over all the dorsal
vertebr&aelig;. If the current be severely painful,
moderate it to endurance. Treat six to
ten minutes twice a day.</p>

<h3>PNEUMONIA.</h3>

<p>Take B D current, forceful as the patient
can bear, and treat briefly&mdash;say five to seven
minutes, several times a day, until relief is
experienced.</p>

<p>Place N. P., <i>long cord</i>, low on back of neck,
and move P. P. over all the upper part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
lungs. Then remove N. P. to the lower dorsal
vertebr&aelig;, just above the kidneys, and treat
with P. P. over the lower part of the lungs.
If typhoid symptoms attend, follow the above
with placing P. P., medium force, on back of
neck, close below the cranium, and N. P. at
coccyx, two or three minutes.</p>

<h3>PULMONARY PHTHISIS. (<i>Consumption.</i>)</h3>

<p>After tubercles have been formed <i>extensively</i>
in the lungs, and have <i>softened down</i> over considerable
area, carrying down the pulmonary
tissue with them into a state of pus, there is
commonly but little hope of successful treatment.
But where they are restricted to comparatively
small extent, and no ulceration
exists, they may be decomposed and absorbed
away, or be thrown off in expectoration, and
the affected parts be healed.</p>

<p>If the case be a <i>recent</i> one, and acute fever,
combined, perhaps, with more or less inflammation,
appear in the lungs, use the A C current,
in moderate force, yet all the patient can
bear without special distress. Place N. P.,
<i>long cord</i>, upon the upper dorsal vertebr&aelig; for
treating the upper part of the lungs, or upon
the lower dorsal vertebr&aelig; for treating their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
lower part. Then pass P. P. over all the
affected parts. Treat in this manner five to
eight minutes, daily, until the <i>inflammation</i> is
suppressed, which will be indicated by an
abatement of the extreme sensitiveness and
lancinating pain under the electrode. Then,
if <i>feverish</i> action continue high, remove the
N. P. to the coccyx, or to the lower part of
the sacrum, taking the B D current, <i>mild</i> force,
with cords of <i>equal length</i>, and treat, as before,
with P. P. over the affected parts, and also
over the thorax generally, and along down
the spine to the lower dorsal vertebr&aelig;. Continue
this treatment ten to fifteen minutes,
daily, until the fever is removed, or nearly so.
For this part of the treatment, it is best to use
the hand as the P. electrode, and to diffuse
the current over the whole palm of the hand
wherever special soreness appears. It is better,
also, that the patient receive the treatment
in bed, secure from any chilliness or current
of air, so as to facilitate perspiration.</p>

<p>If the case be one of long standing, and
more or less of <i>pus</i>, or <i>pus</i> and <i>tubercles</i>, be
raised in coughing, take the A D current,
with equal cords and <i>very</i> mild force. Reduce
the quantity of battery fluid if necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Now place P. P. at the coccyx and treat with
N. P., (the hand is here much the best), over
all the diseased parts. Change occasionally
by removing P. P. to back of neck with <i>long
cord</i>. The object is to bring the diseased parts
under a very light force of the A D current,
such as is especially healing in old ulcers and
chronic irritation. But if this action should
at any time <i>increase</i> fever or inflammation in
the lungs, the poles must be reversed for one
or two treatments. In this stage of the disease,
treat ten to twelve or fifteen minutes, daily,
for three or four days, and after that, three
times a week.</p>

<h3>NEURALGIA AND RHEUMATISM OF THE HEART.</h3>

<p>If <i>neuralgia</i>, use B D current; if <i>rheumatism</i>,
use A D. In either case, treat the heart
with P. P., moderate force, placing N. P. at
lower dorsal or upper lumbar vertebr&aelig;. Treat
five to eight minutes, daily, until relief is
gained.</p>

<p><i>Rheumatism</i> of the heart may be distinguished
from <i>neuralgia</i> by its occasioning irregularity
in the cardiac contractions, commonly
a sense of soreness and pain under pressure by
the hand, and often perceptible enlargement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the organ, which neuralgia does not, and also
by its pains being more constant&mdash;less fitful&mdash;than
those of neuralgia.</p>

<h3>ENLARGEMENT, OR OSSIFICATION OF THE HEART.</h3>

<p>Treat these two affections in the same way.
Take the A D current, moderate force. Place
N. P. at the coccyx, or alternately there and,
with <i>long cord</i>, on the spine opposite to the
heart. Manipulate with P. P. over the heart.
Treat five to eight minutes, three times a week.</p>

<h3>PALPITATION OF THE HEART.</h3>

<p>This is commonly a symptomatic or sympathetic
affection&mdash;<i>rarely</i> idiopathic&mdash;and disappears
on cure of the disease from which it
proceeds. It usually denotes nervous weakness,
and often general debility. <i>General tonic
treatment</i> is indicated, as far as can be given
without interfering with the proper treatment
of any local affections on which the palpitation
depends.</p>

<h3>TORPID LIVER.</h3>

<p>Take A D or B D current, full medium
force. Treat with N. P. over the liver, at the
right side, immediately below the short ribs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and thence backward and a little upward, as
far as to the spine, holding P. P. on the left
side, close under the ribs, for about four to six
minutes. Then remove P. P. to the spine, on
back of neck, two or three minutes. Next,
go with the P. P. to coccyx two or three
minutes; continuing, as at first, to manipulate
with N. P. over the liver. Let the whole
treatment occupy some eight to twelve minutes.
Repeat the sittings about three times
a week.</p>

<h3>HEPATITIS. (<i>Inflammation of Liver.</i>)</h3>

<p>Use the B D current, with what force the
patient can bear. Place N. P. at the coccyx,
and also somewhat on the trunk, opposite to
the inflammation. Then manipulate with P. P.
over the inflamed and sore part. Treat five
to eight minutes, once or twice a day.</p>

<h3>ENLARGEMENT OF LIVER.</h3>

<p>Take A D current, with medium force. Place
N. P., some three to five minutes, on left side,
over the spleen; and then as much longer at
the coccyx. Manipulate with P. P. over the
liver. Treat about three times a week. If the
enlargement be recent, it will subside; if of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
long standing, its restoration will be slow, and
somewhat uncertain.</p>

<h3>BILIARY CALCULI. (<i>Gravel in Liver.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take A C current, strong as can be borne;
and treat the inflamed and painful part with
P. P., while N. P. is upon the right end of
the duodenum. Treat eight to ten minutes,
daily.</p>

<h3>INTERMITTENT FEVER. (<i>Ague and Fever.</i>)</h3>

<p>Use the A D current. First, give <i>general
tonic treatment</i>. (See page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.) Then close
the sitting with a <i>strong</i> current, running from
spleen to liver&mdash;P. P. upon spleen, in the left
side, just below the ribs, and N. P. upon liver&mdash;best
reached in the right side, close under the
ribs, and around backward and a little upward
as far as to the spine. The spleen is morbidly
positive, and probably enlarged, while
the liver is too negative. Treat spleen and
liver in this transverse manner about five
minutes.</p>

<p>If the chills occur on alternate days, treat
on the intervening days; if every day, treat
about two hours before the chill is expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h3>NEPHRITIS. (<i>Inflammation of Kidneys.</i>)</h3>

<p>1. <i>Acute.</i> If the urinary secretion be <i>reddish</i>
and <i>scant</i>, with or without sedimentary
deposit, let the inflammation be regarded as
<i>acute</i>; and use upon it the B D current of good
medium strength, or a little more, if the patient
can bear it. The pain from the current will
probably subside somewhat, and perhaps altogether,
under treatment. Place N. P. at the
coccyx, and manipulate over the inflamed and
sore parts with P. P. Treat five to eight
minutes, twice a day, if the case be recent,
or once a day, if it be of some weeks
standing.</p>

<p>2. <i>Chronic.</i> If it be an old case, and attended
with a brownish or a brickdust-like sediment
in the urine, it may be considered <i>chronic</i>,
and should be treated with a moderate A D
current, once in two days. Place P. P. at the
coccyx, and treat with N. P. over the affected
kidneys. There may be no sense of soreness
or swelling, but <i>dull</i> pain. Treat six
to ten minutes. But if the inflammation
should rise to an active or acute state, <i>reverse
the poles</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h3>RENAL CALCULI. (<i>Gravel in the Kidneys.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take the A C current, of considerable force.
Place N. P. low upon the bladder, and treat
with P. P. upon the inflamed and painful point
five to eight minutes, once or twice a day. If
treating twice a day, continue not more than
five minutes at a time.</p>

<h3>DIABETES. (<i>A Kidney Disease.</i>)</h3>

<p>This disease occurs in two forms&mdash;<i>diabetes
insipidus</i> and <i>diabetes mellitus</i>. In the first
named form, the disease is readily cured. In
the latter, it is very formidable, and is rarely,
if ever, cured by medicines; especially when
of long standing. In this latter variety of the
disease, the urea is absent from the urine, and
in its place is found more or less of sugar&mdash;often
large quantities: Dunglison says 2&frac12; oz.
in a pint.</p>

<p>The electrical state of the disease, in both
of these forms, is negative in excess.</p>

<p>1. <i>D. insipidus.</i> Use the B D current, of
moderate force. Place P. P. at the coccyx or
on the upper dorsal vertebra, or on both in
alternation, which is better, and treat over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
kidneys with N. P. five to eight minutes, once
a day for three or four days. If this should
fail to cure, (as it seldom will), go on with the
same treatment three times a week.</p>

<p>2. <i>D. mellitus.</i> Take the A D current, of
<i>mild</i> force. Place P. P. as in <i>d. insipidus</i>, and
treat the kidneys with N. P. about five to eight
minutes, three times a week; supplementing
this with <i>general tonic treatment</i>, once or twice
a week.</p>

<p><i>Be patient and persevering.</i> In bad cases,
months will be required to effect a cure; but
persistent effort, as above prescribed, will
rarely if ever fail, unless the vital force is
nearly expended.</p>

<h3>DYSPEPSIA.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most difficult of diseases
to control by any of the ordinary modes of
medical practice; and yet, under judicious
electrical treatment, it is one of the surest to
yield. The disease assumes various phases in
different persons, and at different times in the
same person, requiring varied treatment.</p>

<p>The pain, after eating, is severe; exhalations
of air, apparently from the inner surfaces of
the stomach and bowels, or of gas from their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
decomposing contents, are large&mdash;often enormous.
The stomach is much of the time acid,
and, in some cases, sensibly cold, ejecting often
a cold mucus. The bowels are habitually constipated.
The patient is nervous, irritable, and
subject to great depression of spirits. In this
stage or phase of the disease, there is a negative
condition of the digestive apparatus generally.
Treat with the A D current, in mild
force, and expect the case to require considerable
time. But, since there is no approach to
uniformity among patients, no approximation
to definite time can be stated. Give <i>general
tonic treatment</i>, (page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>), three times a week,
and close each sitting with local treatment,
having P. P. at the coccyx, and manipulating
some five minutes with N. P. over the entire
front parts of the abdomen and thorax, and
over the liver.</p>

<p>It is sometimes found, in old cases, that there
is no sensible acidity of stomach; but a <i>pyrosis</i>&mdash;a
burning sensation in the stomach, or a
little above, in what is usually termed "the
pit of the stomach." Treat this about three
minutes with the P. P., strong force; moving N.
P., <i>long cord</i>, over the lower dorsal vertebr&aelig;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>ACUTE DIARRH&#338;A.</h3>

<p>Take B D current. Place N. P., <i>long cord</i>,
upon the lumbar vertebr&aelig; and sacrum, moving
it often along the spine, from a position opposite
to the umbilicus down to the coccyx; and
treat with P. P. over the abdomen, and more
especially wherever pain or sensations of uneasiness
appear. In severe cases, treat several
times in a day&mdash;once in two to three
hours, if need require, three to five minutes at
a time. Use current of full medium strength,
if the patient can bear it.</p>

<h3>CHRONIC DIARRH&#338;A.</h3>

<p>Take A D current, of <i>very mild</i> force. Place
P. P. at the feet, and treat with N. P. over
the lower limbs <i>briefly</i>; then over the bowels
and stomach, both front and rear, some three
to five minutes; then pass up with N. P. over
the anterior parts of the chest, two or three
minutes; and, next, place N. P. low on the
back of neck, with P. P. still at feet, two or
three minutes. Treat in this manner once
daily.</p>

<p>If at any time the bowels should become
unusually flatulent, and evacuations should increase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in frequency, change the treatment.
Place N. P. at back of neck, as before, and
treat about five minutes with P. P. (force increased
to <i>moderate</i> current) over the abdomen,
daily, from one to three days, as may be
necessary. After this, resume treatment as
first above prescribed.</p>

<h3>COLIC&mdash;<i>of whatever kind</i>.</h3>

<p>Use A D current, pretty strong force. In
severe cases, introduce the rectum instrument
N. P., <i>long cord</i>, or in mild cases, place sponge-roll
N. P., <i>long cord</i>, at coccyx, and treat with
P. P. over all the abdomen, three to five minutes.
It may be repeated, if necessary, in
thirty minutes.</p>

<h3>CHOLERA MORBUS.</h3>

<p>Keep the patient still as possible on his
back. Use A D current, strong force. Place
N. P., <i>long cord</i>, at coccyx, and treat with
P. P. over abdomen, five to ten minutes, and
repeat, if necessary, in thirty to sixty minutes.
If there be cramps, touch the contracted
muscles with the P. P., for a few moments,
without disturbing N. P.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHOLERA.&mdash;(<i>Malignant.</i>)</h3>

<p>As in cholera morbus, keep the patient on
his back, still as can be. Use A D current,
<i>full medium strength</i>.</p>

<p>In the early stage, or during the "<i>rice-water</i>"
discharges, and down to the time of
collapse, treat the abdomen and thorax with
P. P., having N. P., <i>long cord</i>, on back of
neck&mdash;not too near the head. After treating
so a few moments&mdash;say four to six minutes&mdash;remove
P. P. to the back, and pass it along
close upon each side of the spinous processes
from the lower lumbar up to about the middle
of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;. Continue this about
three or four minutes.</p>

<p>If <i>cramping</i> accompany the vomiting and
purging, carry the P. P. a part of the time to
the muscles in spasm, leaving N. P. still at
the back of neck, with <i>long cord</i>.</p>

<p>Repeat the above processes as often as once
an hour until symptoms improve. Then reduce
their frequency as the case will admit of.</p>

<p><i>In the state of collapse</i>, place P. P., <i>long
cord</i>, at the coccyx, and manipulate with N.
P. over the entire trunk and arms; bestowing
a larger share of treatment along up the spine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
than elsewhere. Then remove P. P., <i>long
cord</i>, to feet, and work with N. P. all over the
lower limbs and hips. Treat in this stage of
the disease some six or eight minutes at a
time, and repeat it as the case seems to demand&mdash;once
in thirty minutes to once in two,
four or six hours, until improvement or death
shall ensue. (See page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.)</p>

<h3>DYSENTERY.</h3>

<p>Treat exactly as in <i>acute diarrh&#339;a</i>, except
that P. P. should be moved more over the
<i>colon</i> and <i>rectum</i> than in diarrh&#339;a.</p>

<h3>CONSTIPATION OF BOWELS.</h3>

<p>This disease may proceed from either a <i>negative</i>
condition&mdash;a state of <i>atony</i> from lack of
nutrition, or a <i>partial paralysis</i> of the bowels&mdash;or
from a <i>positive</i> condition&mdash;a state of <i>relaxation</i>
and consequent weakness of the muscular
tissues of the bowels. In either of these cases,
the peristaltic action of the intestines becomes
enfeebled, and constipation ensues.</p>

<p>In either case, use the A D current, of medium
force. In the first-mentioned case, place
P. P. at back of neck, or in the mouth with
tongue instrument, and treat with N. P. over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
liver, stomach and bowels; or place N. P. at
the anus. Treat so five to eight minutes.</p>

<p>In the second-specified case, place N. P. at
back of neck or on the dorsal vertebr&aelig;, and
treat with P. P. over the bowels five to eight
minutes.</p>

<p>In both cases, repeat the treatment daily
until relief is afforded. Or, if the case be
<i>chronic</i>, treat daily for three or four days, and,
after that, three times a week. It is well also
to give <i>general tonic treatment</i> as often as once
a week. The patient should be urged to retire
and <i>invite</i> an evacuation regularly, about the
same hour daily, whether success attend it
or not.</p>

<h3>H&AElig;MORRHOIDS. (<i>Piles.</i>)</h3>

<p>If the case be recent, take the B D current;
if old, take A D. Place the patient in a recumbent
position, and let the rectum instrument,
P. P., be introduced, <i>wet</i>. Manipulate
with N. P. along the spine upon the dorsal
vertebr&aelig;. Where there is <i>prolapsus ani</i>, the
sponge-roll, placed at the anus, may be used
instead of the rectum instrument, particularly
for the first few treatments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3>RHEUMATISM. (<i>Acute Inflammatory.</i>)</h3>

<p>First ascertain if the kidneys be morbidly
positive&mdash;urine scant and too highly colored.
If so, as is commonly the case, begin with the
B D current, good medium force. Place N. P.
at the pelvis, and treat over the kidneys with
P. P. some three or four minutes. Let this be
the commencement of every treatment until
<i>this</i> difficulty is corrected.</p>

<p>Next, change to A D current. If the disease
be located in the hips or lower limbs, put
the feet in warm water with the tin electrode
N. P., or place the sponge-roll N. P. at the
soles of the feet, and treat with P. P. upon
and a little above the affected parts; using
such force of current as the patient can bear.
The pain will commonly subside under treatment.
If the disease be as low as the ankles
or feet, use the <i>long cord</i> with N. P.</p>

<p>If the shoulders, arms or hands be affected,
treat them on the same principles as are prescribed
for the <i>lower</i> limbs; using the <i>long
cord</i> with N. P. when the disease is below the
elbows.</p>

<p>When the disease is in the hands or feet, or
near to them, if the shoulders or hips be not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
involved, it is often necessary, after three or
four treatments as above described, to <i>reverse
the poles</i> for a few moments, giving an ascending
current; but still using the <i>long cord</i>
with N. P.</p>

<p>If the disease be located anywhere in the
trunk, neck or head, treat the affected part
with P. P., placing N. P. on some adjacent
part of the spine, and usually at a point somewhat
<i>lower down</i> than the disease.</p>

<p>For acute inflammatory rheumatism, treat
once a day. The length of time for each
treatment must depend on the location and
extent of the affected part or parts. In this
matter, the practitioner must decide for himself,
or infer from the time prescribed in the
treatment of other inflammatory affections.</p>

<h3>RHEUMATISM. (<i>Chronic.</i>)</h3>

<p>Use the A D current <i>always</i> in rheumatic
affections. If there be no visible inflammation
or swelling in the diseased parts, approach
such parts in the same manner as in acute inflammatory
rheumatism, except with <i>reversed
poles</i>. The parts affected require to come
under the N. P. rather than the P. P., and to
be treated with considerable force. There are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i>apparently</i> exceptional cases, referred to on
page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>, which see.</p>

<p>Where joints are being dislocated, treat the
parts with N. P., quite mild force, so long as
it can be done without exciting acute inflammation.
If this should arise, it must be repressed
with P. P.</p>

<p>Treat chronic rheumatism about three times
a week.</p>

<h3>DROPSY.</h3>

<p>Use the A D current, moderate force. Give
<i>general tonic treatment</i>; then place P. P. with
the feet, in a vessel of warm water, or place
the sponge-roll P. P. at the soles of the feet,
and treat the affected parts a few minutes
with N. P., to quicken the absorbents. If the
disease be in the feet or lower limbs, use <i>long
cord</i> with P. P. while treating them. Next
place N. P. upon the lower part of the bladder,
or, what is better, immediately below the
pubic articulation, and treat over the kidneys
three to five minutes with P. P. Repeat the
treatments about three times a week.</p>

<h3>NEURALGIA.</h3>

<p>If the disease be general in the system,
moving from place to place, or causing transient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
acute pains here and there, give general
tonic treatment, three times a week, for several
weeks&mdash;perhaps a month or two, provided the
case be an old one. This will invigorate the
nervous system and equalize the electric action.
<i>Relief</i> will be afforded soon; but for the sake
of <i>cure</i>, the treatment of an old case should be
continued as here directed. If the disease be
<i>local</i>, use the B D current, with as much force
as the patient can bear without irritating painfulness.
Treat the affected part, or parts,
with P. P., placing N. P., <i>long cord</i>, upon
some approximate healthy part, at a point a
little lower down than the part in pain. The
spine, when convenient, is commonly the best
point for it. In treating the painful part, pass
the electrode more or less also over the nerves
adjacent to the one principally affected. Treat
five to eight minutes daily.</p>

<h3>SCIATICA.</h3>

<p>This is neuralgia in an ischiatic nerve, commonly
the <i>great</i> ischiatic.</p>

<p>Use the B D current, strong as the patient
can well bear. Place the foot in warm water
with N. P., or place the sponge-roll N. P. at
the sole of the foot, (the former is the best,)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and treat with P. P. over the painful part,
and also, more or less, over adjacent parts.
It is also well, in order to prevent too much
exhaustion of the limb, to <i>reverse the poles</i>
every third or fourth time; but in so doing,
use the <i>long cord</i> with N. P.</p>

<h3>PARALYSIS.</h3>

<p>Take the B D current, medium force. If
the paralysis be in a lower limb, place P. P.,
<i>long cord</i>, upon the lower lumbar vertebr&aelig;, so
as to reach the hypogastric plexus, and treat
with the metallic brush, N. P., five to eight
minutes, over all the affected parts. Then close
the sitting with <i>reversed poles</i>, about one to two
minutes, having P. P., <i>long cord</i>, at the foot,
and manipulating over the parts affected, and
especially over the lumbar vertebr&aelig;, with N.
P. This is to prevent depletion by <i>running
off</i> the electro-vital fluid too much, and to force
the electric current through the nerves in an
upward and inward tonic-giving direction. If
the disease be in an arm or hand, treat it in
a manner analogous to the above; extending
the treatment from back of neck to the affected
parts.</p>

<p>In case of <i>hemiplegia</i> or <i>paraplegia</i>, run the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
current from the healthy <i>side</i> of the spine, (in
hemiplegia,) or from a healthy <i>part</i> of the
spine, (in paraplegia,) to and through the paralyzed
parts, by placing P. P., <i>long cord</i>, on
spine, and manipulating with N. P., metallic
brush commonly, upon the parts paralyzed.
Close the treatment with reversed poles for a
moment or two, as in the preceding cases. <i>Old</i>
paralysis requires considerable <i>time</i> to cure it.
Treat about three times a week, occasionally
omitting a week.</p>

<h3>ERYSIPELAS.</h3>

<p>Take the A. D. current, medium force, in
all forms of the diseases.</p>

<p>1. When acute, and characterized by high
inflammation, with bright, smooth swelling,
and spreading gradually and sometimes rapidly
to surrounding parts; or when small vesicles
appear on the inflamed parts, which dry
up in little branlike scales and fall off.</p>

<p>If it be located anywhere upon the face,
place N. P., <i>long cord</i>, upon back of neck, and
treat the parts affected with P. P. Treat
about three to five minutes at a time, three or
four times daily.</p>

<p>If it be located in the arm or hand, place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the extremity in tepid water with N. P., <i>long
cord</i>, and treat upon or just above the diseased
part with P. P.</p>

<p>If it be in any part of the trunk, (which, in
this form, is not so common,) place N. P., <i>long
cord</i>, upon some point of the spine as near the
diseased part as may be, but a little lower
down, and treat the part affected with P. P.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, treat briefly, but
frequently, as directed above.</p>

<p>2. When small, blister-like, serous vesicles&mdash;<i>phlyct&aelig;na</i>&mdash;appear,
and the inflammation
terminates in gangrene; or when there is
such an infiltration of serum as to produce an
&#339;dematous condition, place P. P., <i>long cord</i>,
upon some convenient healthy part, (the spinal
cord, or other nerve centre which gives nervous
service to the part affected, is best,) and treat
the lesion with N. P., <i>light force</i>, five to eight
minutes daily.</p>

<h3>ERUPTIVE CUTANEOUS DISEASES.</h3>

<p>Take A D current, pretty <i>vigorous</i> force in
<i>acute</i> cases; <i>mild</i> in <i>chronic</i> affections. If the
eruption be inflamed and acute, use <i>long cord</i>
with N. P.; if sluggish and chronic, use <i>long
cord</i> with P. P. Move the two electrodes parallel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to each other, upon the patient, about two
or three inches apart; and pass them over all
the affected surface. Repeat the treatment
daily in acute affections, and three times a
week in chronic cases.</p>

<h3>COMMON CRAMP.</h3>

<p>Although either the positive or the negative
pole, applied to the healthy muscle, may produce
spasmodic contraction, yet the negative
pole contracts much more powerfully than the
positive&mdash;a fact which shows an electrically
<i>plus</i> condition in the nerves and muscles involved.
Yet we know that cramps are more
apt to attend a <i>low</i> condition of general vitality
in the system than the opposite. From several
considerations, which can not be detailed here,
I am led to think that cramps are produced,
generally, at least, by a temporary or spasmodic
<i>reaction</i> of the electro-vital force from
an improperly negative to an excessively positive
state in the parts affected.</p>

<p>My practice is, when the spasm is on, to
treat the parts in cramp by momentary touches
rapidly repeated, with the P. P. of the B D or
A D current, good medium force, placing N. P.
at the back of neck, if the disturbance be in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
arm; or at the coccyx, if it be in a leg or in
the abdomen or chest.</p>

<p>In treating parts subject to cramp while the
spasm is <i>not</i> on, give them, along with other
parts of the system, <i>general tonic treatment</i>, as
directed on page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>. This elevates and equalizes
the electro-vital action, and relieves the
difficulty.</p>

<h3>TRISMUS. (<i>Lockjaw.</i>)</h3>

<p>For traumatic trismus, use the B D current,
of vigorous force. Let the wound be kept
open and clear, except that soothing emollients
may be applied. Place N. P. at the
coccyx, or near it on the spine; and then
treat, by firm but momentary touches of the
P. P., over the lower maxillary&mdash;<i>pterygoid</i>&mdash;muscles
and nerves; indeed, over the <i>entire</i>
lower jaw and its articulations. Treat five to
ten minutes, if necessary, or until the jaws
relax.</p>

<h3>TETANUS.</h3>

<p>This is substantially the same thing as <i>trismus</i>,
except that it extends to other parts, and
often to nearly all the muscles of the organism.
Under ordinary treatment, it is almost invariably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
fatal. I am not aware that it has been
sufficiently submitted to <i>our</i> electrical system
to determine satisfactorily the question of its
amenability to it. Yet I see no reason to doubt
that, in the most of cases, when taken within
reasonable time, it may be cured.</p>

<p>Use the B D current, in pretty strong
force. Place the N. P., <i>long cord</i>, at the feet,
and treat with P. P. from the medulla oblongata,
or from the upper cervical vertebra, all
along down the spine, for several minutes&mdash;say,
three to five minutes. Then pass with
P. P. over the whole trunk and limbs. Continue
to treat until relaxation takes place, or
all hope of relief departs.</p>

<h3>CANCERS.</h3>

<p>Cancers take on a variety of forms, distinguished
by different names; but since they
all require substantially the same electrical
treatment, it is unnecessary here to describe
them.</p>

<p>Begin with the A B current in pretty full
volume. [The <i>volume</i> of the current is increased
by increasing the quantity of battery
fluid.] Use this for several weeks, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
change to the A D current. Treat daily. The
time for each treatment must be determined
by the judgment of the practitioner; varying
it according to the peculiar character and
location of the disease.</p>

<p>If the cancer be on the face, or on any part
of the head or breast, place P. P. on back of
neck; but if it be in the stomach, uterus, or
any of the abdominal viscera, place P. P. on
spine, a little higher than the affected part.
Then treat the disease with N. P., <i>long cord</i>,
so as to run the current immediately <i>out</i> from
the lesion, and yet bring the latter on the
<i>negative</i> side<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> of the central point in the circuit;
that is, within the negative half of the
whole circuit.</p>

<h3>ASPHYXIA. (<i>Suspended Animation.</i>)</h3>

<p>Use B D current, pretty strong force. Place
P. P. at back of neck&mdash;second or third cervical
vertebra, and treat with N. P., over all the
chest and along the lower margin of the ribs,
so as to excite the pectoral muscles, lungs and
diaphragm.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h3>RECENT WOUNDS, CONTUSIONS AND BURNS.</h3>

<p>Use the B D current, strong force as can be
borne. Bring the lesion under P. P., and
place N. P. at discretion, in view of the location
of the injury. Treat five to eight minutes,
twice or thrice on the same day. Unless
the injury is very severe, no further treatment
will be required. Healing will take place with
little or no soreness or swelling. In severe
cases, repeat the treatment whenever inflammation
gets too high. If <i>fungus</i>&mdash;"proud
flesh"&mdash;should appear, treat that with a small-pointed
electrode, N. P., placing P. P. on a
healthy part, not remote, using A C current,
in pretty strong force.</p>

<h3>OLD ULCERS.</h3>

<p>Take the A D current. If <i>torpid</i>, treat with
mild force. Treat the sore with N. P., while
P. P. is held upon some healthy part, and
usually at a higher point. Treat five to ten
minutes, three or four times a week. If <i>high
inflammation</i> be present, this must first be
reduced by applying P. P., in pretty strong
force, with N. P., on a healthy part not far
away. For this purpose, treat some five to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
eight minutes daily. Then, when the inflammation
is sufficiently subdued, treat as when
<i>torpid</i>, with mild force and less frequently. It
is best, when it can be done, to place the
affected part in warm water along with N. P.;
bringing the ulcer immediately above the surface
of the water.</p>

<h3>HEMORRHAGE.</h3>

<p>Take B D current, strong force. Apply P.
P. to the open blood-vessel, or as near to it as
possible; placing N. P., <i>long cord</i>, to some adjacent
part, and, as nearly as practicable, in the
direction from which the blood chiefly comes.</p>

<h3>CHLOROSIS. (<i>Green Sickness.</i>)</h3>

<p>This is a disease mostly or entirely peculiar
to young women who have not menstruated,
and disappears on the establishment of the
monthly periods.</p>

<p>Take the A D current. If any symptoms
exist of an effort of nature to bring on the
menses, note the <i>time</i> of them, and regard it,
in the treatment, as the proper monthly period.
If no symptoms of such a period are perceptible,
the practitioner must <i>fix</i> upon a time for
it, and regard it accordingly. About four to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
six days before the periodic time, commence to
treat as follows, using a <i>moderate force</i>: Insert
the uterine electrode, N. P., wet in warm water,
per vagina, until it meets the uterus; and manipulate
with P. P. over the dorsal and first two
lumbar vertebr&aelig;, and more or less over the
back on both sides of the spinal column, some
six or eight minutes daily, down to the period
fixed upon for the catamenia to appear. If
they do not start, let the patient rest for some
four or five days, and then begin with <i>general
tonic treatment</i>. (See page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.) Continue this,
three times a week, until within a little less
than a week of the <i>periodic</i> time, when the
same treatment with the uterine electrode as
was at first employed should be resumed, and
again be continued to the time assigned for
the menses. If no success should appear, return,
after a few days, to <i>general tonic treatment</i>
as before. Let these forms of treatment
be prosecuted until success crowns the effort.
Ordinarily, not many months&mdash;perhaps not
more than one or two months&mdash;will be required;
especially, if the treatment be aided, on the
part of the patient, by a good degree of moderate
exercise in the open air, and a free,
nourishing diet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMENORRH&#338;A. (<i>Suppressed Menstruation.</i>)</h3>

<p>Treat as for <i>chlorosis</i>. But if the case be
recent&mdash;the effect of taking cold&mdash;begin, in the
first few sittings, to treat eight or ten minutes
as for common cold; then conclude the sitting
by treating, about as many minutes, in the
same manner as prescribed for chlorosis.</p>

<h3>DYSMENORRH&#338;A. (<i>Painful Menstruation.</i>)</h3>

<p>If the disease be occasioned by uterine displacement,
obstructing the <i>os uteri</i>, the organ
must be restored to its normal position. This
can best be done by mechanical action. But
it is most commonly occasioned by irritation of
the mucus membrane lining the interior cavity
of the uterus. Mucus surfaces, under <i>chronic</i>
irritation, are electrically negative. Therefore,
in this case, if it be an <i>old</i> one, taking the
A D current, <i>very mild force</i>, apply the uterine
electrode, N. P., to the <i>os uteri</i>, and treat over
the lower dorsal and upper lumbar vertebr&aelig;
with P. P., <i>long cord</i>. Treat five to eight
minutes, three times a week.</p>

<p>But I should add, that recovery from this
infirmity, when occasioned by uterine irritation,
will be much aided by commencing each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
sitting with a <i>general tonic treatment</i> (see page
<a href="#Page_95">95</a>), and closing with the treatment just above
prescribed.</p>

<p>The last described form of dysmenorrh&#339;a is
sometimes attended with spasmodic contraction
of the <i>os uteri</i>, thus preventing the catamenial
flow. This may be readily relieved by
applying P. P. to uterus, and N. P. to lower
dorsal and upper lumbar vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<h3>MENORRHAGIA. (<i>Excessive Menstruation.</i>)</h3>

<p>If the menstrual flow is apt to terminate in
hemorrhage, it is best to give <i>general tonic
treatments</i>, about three times a week, between
the periods; and during the last four or five
days before color is expected to appear, to
take the B D current, medium force, and treat
the uterus directly, once a day, with the uterine
electrode P. P., while moving N. P. over
the dorsal vertebr&aelig;, about five to eight minutes,
at the close of <i>general tonic treatment</i>.</p>

<p>If there be no <i>hemorrhage</i>, properly, but
only too profuse or too long-continued flow of
catamenia, the discharge may commonly be
stopped by one or two treatments, of eight to
ten minutes each, with the uterine electrode,
as prescribed above.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h3>PROLAPSUS UTERI. (<i>Falling of the Womb.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take the B D current, of good medium force,
and give <i>general tonic treatment</i> (see page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>),
on alternate days, ten minutes, passing briefly
over the several parts. After this, treat five
to eight minutes with uterine electrode, in the
manner prescribed for <i>menorrhagia</i>. Then
close the sitting by removing the uterine instrument,
substituting the sponge-cup as P. P.,
and treating with it externally, about five
minutes, over the pelvic region, while N. P. is
stationed on the spine, at the first or second
dorsal vertebra.</p>

<p>On the <i>intervening</i> days, treat only with the
uterine electrode, as above prescribed.</p>

<h3>LEUCORRH&#338;A. (<i>Whites.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take A D current, <i>very mild</i> force. Introduce
the vaginal electrode, N. P., until it
meets the uterus, and manipulate with P. P.
over the dorsal vertebr&aelig; five to eight minutes,
three times a week. Once or twice a week,
on the intervening days, give <i>general tonic
treatment</i>. Omit treatment altogether, for one
or two weeks, once in two to three months.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Considerable time is often required for the
cure of old cases.</p>

<h3>SPERMATORRH&#338;A.</h3>

<p>The points to be gained are, to reduce the
action of the amatorial organs of the brain
and the secretion of the <i>testes</i>, and to contract
and strengthen the tissue of the seminal vesicles
and the prostrate gland.</p>

<p>Take the B D current. First, treat the
lowest part of the cerebellum, on both sides of
the spinal cord, with a <i>mild</i> force; using P. P.
upon these organs of amativeness, and N. P.
on the dorsal vertebr&aelig;. Treat so some three
minutes. Next, increase the current to medium
force; and, taking a handled cup or
mug, holding a pint to a quart, mostly filled
with tepid water, drop the <i>penis</i> and <i>testicles</i>
into it, along with the tin electrode P. P., and
move N. P., <i>long cord</i>, over the lumbar vertebr&aelig;.
Treat in this manner about five minutes.
Then place the P. P. on the pelvis,
close above the penis, and again treat with N.
P., <i>long cord</i>, over the small of the back, two
or three minutes. Treat about three times a
week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<h3>IMPOTENCE.</h3>

<p>Take B D current, moderate force. Treat
exactly as in spermatorrh&#339;a, except with <i>reversed
poles</i>, using the <i>long cord</i> with P. P.
Treat thrice a week.</p>
